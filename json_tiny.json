Despite the fact that they have yet to shoot a single frame, stars Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin and showrunner/co-creator Alex Gansa had a lot to talk about when meeting with reporters on Thursday afternoon at the Television Critics Association's summer press tour.\n\nAs casting and teased log lines have implied, the sixth season will focus on the election \u2014 or rather, its immediate aftermath. It takes place between Election Day and the presidential inauguration. But just because the drama, which tries to keep pace with current events, has cast a woman (Elizabeth Marvel) to play the president elect does not mean that they're sure Hillary Clinton will win in November.\n\n\"Every season, when we're developing stories, we're terrified of being counterfactual by the time we air,\" said Gansa. \"This year, we're hedging our bets a little bit. She's a little bit Hillary, a little bit Donald Trump and a little bit Bernie Sanders.\"\n\nHe continued: \"If you listen to Donald Trump, there are these people who run the government from administration to administration and they have completely screwed the world up. There is part of that in our president. There is also a little bit of Hillary, in terms of she's a pragmatist and knows Washington from the inside.\"\n\n'Homeland' Casts Female President for Season 6\n\nTouching on Trump specifically, Gansa noted that one of the many people they've consulted about is general and former NSA head Michael Hayden. Hayden has been outspoken about the potential dangers of a Trump presidency. \"I think it's fair to say there's some concern,\" Gansa offered.\n\nWhen asked why they chose New York over Washington, D.C., Gansa pointed to it being Danes' primary residence. They both also offered up that it naturally plays into a national security narrative. \"The most life-altering, country-changing event in the world happened in New York on Sept. 11,\" offered Gansa. \"We are still dealing with the reaction to that as a country. Someone might argue there was an overreaction in the aftermath. ... Those are the things we're dealing with this season.\"\n\nThe president elect, a junior New York Senator, will be conducting the transition out of her home state.\n\nThe biggest question in the aftermath of Homeland's fifth season was the fate of Rupert Friend's character. And, despite Quinn seemingly dying in the last scenes, Friend is still listed as a series regular.\n\n'Homeland' Near Renewal for Seasons 7 and 8, Won't Return Until 2017\n\n\"Quinn is alive,\" said Gansa of the character. \"I can say that much, but we really want to be careful about revealing what his condition is. He suffered a major stroke last season. You are going to see a very changed and altered Quinn this year. I think Quinn, this coming season, will really represent a profound and familiar casualty of the war on terror for our audience. What he endured last year is different from what he'll go through this year. This year will be suffused with his daily relationship with Claire's character.\"\n\nDanes did not talk much about about her character's emotional storylines, but she did touch on her relationship with Patinkin's Saul. \"I think that they have diverged,\" she said. \"There has been a split that they've been working on repairing over the course of the last couple of seasons \u2014 to varying degrees of success. Saul has committed himself even more to the agency, and Carrie rejects some fundamental principals of it. They are still profoundly bonded.\"\n\nAs Showtime boss David Nevins announced in June, Homeland will get a seventh and eighth season. It could still go on after that \u2014 but when asked if he had an idea about an endgame, Gansa offered a shrug.\n\n\"I wish,\" he said. \"We really don't. David Nevins says we take the show season by season. We take it episode by episode. Pie in the sky, we would all like to take the show back to Israel for the final season. It would be great to end the run there, but it's a big question if we could ever go back.\"", "summary": "Alex Gansa also notes that, should they be able to, he'd like to see the final season film in Israel.", "density": 1.2083333333, "coverage": 0.7916666667000001, "compression": 35.2083333333, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/sports/ncaafootball/01harbaugh.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2011010119id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/sports/ncaafootball/01harbaugh.html", "title": "Beyond Orange Bowl, Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Harbaugh Remains Coy About His Future", "date": "2011010119", "text": "The question gains dimension with each new rumor coming down Florida\u2019s Turnpike. After four seasons at Stanford, Harbaugh is at a professional crossroads, the direction he takes hinging on his personal signpost of success.\n\nIs it staying put and making football matter at a university focused on academic excellence? Is it feeding the football frenzy at his alma mater, Michigan? Or is it taking his coaching talents to the N.F.L.?\n\nOn the topic of his future, the plainspoken Harbaugh has been uncharacteristically circumspect. After leading the fifth-ranked Cardinal through a spirited practice here at Barry University on Wednesday, he insisted that his focus was firmly on Stanford\u2019s game against Virginia Tech on Monday.\n\nWhen pressed about the speculation that he would leave the Farm for greener pastures, Harbaugh offered this: \u201cI just love to compete and I like challenges.\u201d\n\nAt Stanford, Harbaugh has taken a program that won one game in 2006, the season before he arrived, and guided it to an 11-1 record this season. The Cardinal last competed in a major bowl after the 1999 season, and there are those who believe this year\u2019s team is bumping up against an ivory-tower ceiling.\n\nHarbaugh has been offered a new contract to stay at Stanford and try to mold a program limited by rigorous academic standards into a perennial B.C.S. power. But nobody would be surprised to see him bolt, either to Michigan, whose coach, Rich Rodriguez, is said to be on shaky ground, or to the N.F.L., where his older brother, John, is coach of the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n\u201cIt really is a philosophical decision,\u201d John Harbaugh said in a telephone interview.\n\nAs much as he would love to see his brother in the N.F.L., ideally with a franchise in the National Football Conference so that their head-to-head meetings would be infrequent, John Harbaugh added, \u201cIn the end I think he\u2019s going to go with his heart, which might be a good thing for Stanford.\u201d\n\nIf anybody is capable of reading Harbaugh\u2019s mind as he mulls his options, it is John L. Smith, who remade a one-victory Louisville team into an 11-win program in four years in the early 2000s. Faced with some of the same frustrations gnawing at Harbaugh, including an inability to sell out home games despite the team\u2019s success, Smith left Louisville for Michigan State. He was fired after four seasons and is now the special-teams coach at Arkansas.\n\nSpeaking by telephone from New Orleans, where the Razorbacks are preparing for the Sugar Bowl, Smith said: \u201cReally, to be honest with you, I felt like I backed myself into a corner I couldn\u2019t get out of when I made the decision to leave. In hindsight, I wish I would have been open enough to suck it up and sit down with the A.D. and say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to leave, but this is what I need.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Cardinal is making its first appearance in the Orange Bowl, but Harbaugh has been here before. His father, Jack, was an assistant coach under Bo Schembechler at Michigan when the Wolverines lost to Oklahoma, the eventual national champion, in the 1976 Orange Bowl. The week was memorable, Harbaugh\u2019s father recalled, for a side trip to Disney World that Schembechler arranged for the Wolverines\u2019 traveling party.\n\nAt the end of the day, Harbaugh, then 12, and his brother begged their father to let them go on one more ride, which caused them to be a few minutes late getting back to the bus for the ride to the airport and the return flight to Miami.\n\nJack Harbaugh, whose coaching career spanned more than 40 years and who led Western Kentucky to the Division 1-AA national title in 2002, said: \u201cI remember thinking, that\u2019s it, my job\u2019s gone, because Bo Schembechler waits for no one. We sprinted to the bus and got on and Bo was in the first seat. He looked down as we walked past and then I was sure I was going to be fired. A few minutes later, Bo\u2019s wife and younger son get on the bus, the doors closed behind them and we took off.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh\u2019s father laughed and said, \u201cBo\u2019s kid saved my job.\u201d\n\nOn a day when the Florida sun was giving off less heat than usual, Jack Harbaugh was warmed by the sight of his son conducting practice.\n\n\u201cWhen I see John and Jim, I see what I wish I could have been as a coach,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a passion. And the thing I enjoy about watching them is how they both can be tough and demanding but how their players also seem to rally around them. I came up in an era where you coached by fear and intimidation. I envy them a little for the relationships they have with their players.\u201d\n\nMembers of this year\u2019s Stanford team speak of Harbaugh\u2019s infectious energy and enthusiasm and his compulsion to win, which they say is also catching. He can make them gasp with his high-intensity practices, but he can also make them laugh, as he did while delivering his postpractice comments on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is hard not to be fired up with him,\u201d Richard Sherman, a senior cornerback, said, adding, \u201cHe made people believe that winning is possible anywhere, and don\u2019t let the academic standards or anything bring you down or make you think you can\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh, 47, was a star quarterback at Michigan and played 15 seasons in the N.F.L. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which includes a stint coaching the Oakland Raiders\u2019 quarterbacks in 2002 and 2003, makes him an attractive candidate to replace Mike Singletary, who was fired on Sunday, as the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 next coach.\n\nWhen Singletary\u2019s ouster was made public, John Harbaugh said: \u201cI thought to myself, I can\u2019t imagine Jim not being mentioned for that job. I think it would be a great fit.\u201d\n\nOthers apparently feel the same way. In an online survey, readers of The San Jose Mercury News Web site favored Harbaugh over Jon Gruden and Mike Holmgren as Singletary\u2019s replacement.\n\nHarbaugh\u2019s name has also surfaced in North Carolina, where the Panthers have announced that John Fox will not return and where Andrew Luck, Stanford\u2019s junior quarterback, could be headed as the No. 1 overall draft pick if he decides to turn pro.\n\nThe speculation about his future, Harbaugh said, has not been a distraction.\n\n\u201cI just concentrate on doing a good job at what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just very superficial in that way. I\u2019m as transparent as a baggie. There\u2019s nothing deep. You can\u2019t peel back the onion.\u201d\n\nIf anything has pierced his focus this month, Harbaugh said, it has been the cries of his 2-week-old daughter, Katherine, who made the trip to South Florida with Harbaugh\u2019s wife, Sarah, and their 2-year-old daughter, Addison.\n\n\u201cFootball and family, that\u2019s pretty much been my focus,\u201d he said.\n\nHarbaugh has invited his entire clan to Monday\u2019s game. If the Baltimore Ravens clinch a first-round playoff bye over the weekend, John Harbaugh said he would make the trip.\n\nIf Harbaugh\u2019s brother and sister, Joani, and their families all can make it, it would be magical, like 1976 once more. It would be hard to game-plan it much better, ringing in a new year, one pregnant with possibilities, together.", "summary": "Few at Stanford would be surprised if Jim Harbaugh, who has led the Cardinal to the Orange Bowl and an 11-1 record, stays put, bolts for a blue-chip program or heads to the N.F.L.", "density": 1.9512195122, "coverage": 0.8780487805, "compression": 36.1219512195, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/boxing/manny-pacquiao-donald-trump-friendly-article-1.2505509", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2016012219id_/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/boxing/manny-pacquiao-donald-trump-friendly-article-1.2505509", "title": "Manny Pacquiao says Donald Trump is 'friendly'", "date": "2016012219", "text": "Thursday, January 21, 2016, 10:53 PM\n\nManny Pacquiao, a congressman in the Philippines who is running for senator, couldn\u2019t help but laugh Thursday when asked about U.S. politics, almost as if he knew a question about Donald Trump was coming.\n\nThe 37-year-old boxer didn\u2019t wish to get too involved in stateside politics, but he says he knows Trump, who invited him to be a judge for last year\u2019s Miss Universe pageant.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a friendly guy,\u201d Pacquiao said of the GOP candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s always direct to the point.

Let the global build-up resume.\n\nGreg Ghodsi, senior vice president at Raymond James, says clients have cut cash allocations from 40% of their portfolios in January to 10% now.\n\n\"Investors are getting more comfortable with investing in the market. They're not placing huge bets. And we're taking baby steps with them to get back into the market,\" he says. Some areas he likes for the next six months include base metals, commodities and international stocks. He also suggested that investors look into corporate bonds as another good investment opportunity.\n\nFollow Intelligent Investing on Twitter\n\nSign up for the Weekly Intelligent Investing Newsletter\n\nRon Sloan, senior portfolio manager for Invesco Aim, likes firms that are self-sustaining, can fund their own growth, don't need capital markets, have strong cash flows and are sellers to the world outside the U.S. Right now he's finding a lot of these firms in the industrial and technology worlds, and likes names like ITT ( ITT - news - people ), Rockwell, Illinois Tool Works ( ITW - news - people ) and Nokia ( NOK - news - people ). Though at first blush these firms seem to have little in common Sloan sees that they are all strong, quality Western firms that sell either tools or technology that is not available in the developing world.\n\nVince Farrell, chief investment officer at Soleil Securities, also sees good investment vehicles in large-cap technology companies including Cisco ( CSCO - news - people ), Intel ( INTC - news - people ) and Oracle. Some other stocks that Farrell anticipates will provide good returns in the next six months include consumer staple companies such as General Mills ( GIS - news - people ), Heinz ( HNZ - news - people ) and Comcast ( CMCSA - news - people ) as well as energy stocks like Exxon.\n\nAnother good place to look is in inflation-protected index funds, says John Osbon, founder of Osbon Capital Management. These funds, he says, rise with inflation and are government-backed, so investors are guaranteed to be paid. One name to look at here is the iShares Barclays TIPS ( TIP - news - people ).\n\nOsbon also believes that essential service municipal bonds, such as those related to water and sewers, are good investments because they are usually AAA rated and have yields above taxable yields. One way to play this is via the iShares S&P National Municipal Bond Fund ( MUB - news - people ).\n\nNow is also a time for investors to re-evaluate their investment strategies and determine their risk capacity, says Carol Pepper, chief executive officer of Pepper International. \"I think people need to look at and make more conservative the percentage of their money that they put into any kind of either hedge funds and other illiquid assets or risky equity assets that are going to continue to be volatile until we get movements,\" she says. And Pepper advises that investors take advantage of the rally while the market is going up. \"For my clients, we're fairly confident we don't want to miss the rally. So we're more than, I'd say, more than halfway invested in the percentage we should have into equities.\"\n\nForbes: What are your investment ideas for the next six months as we come into what will then close out 2009? What are some things you are advising clients for the next six months, since we're in this kind of middle ground right now, this no man's or no woman's land?\n\nCarol Pepper: Well, I think, you know, we always talk about this. We talk about asset allocation. Just have to know what their asset allocation is. Now there's the tactical, so there's your long-term strategy, what percentage you want in stocks, bonds, cash and alternatives, for most people. And then there's tactically where you are relative to that. So, for example, a lot of people, let's say their allocation to equities was 50% or 60% in the old days, many investors had what we used to call a 60/40 portfolio, 60% equities and 40% fixed income in the good old days.\n\nAfter the devastation of this year, you know, just by market losses, they lost half of that. They're down to 30% or less in equities. And perhaps their fixed income just because their values went down. Or they bailed and they sold. So the question becomes on a practical purpose for the investors, \"Do I go back in? Or, you know, what do I do?\"\n\nFirst of all, I think people need to look at and make more conservative the percentage of their money that they put into any kind of either hedge funds and other illiquid assets or risky equity assets that are going to continue to be volatile until we get movements. But having said that, so let's say your old portfolio is 60/40, just to be simplistic.\n\nNow you may want to say, \"Well, maybe my pain point is really more like 40% equities at the max. And of that, I'm comfortable being in the market 25% or 50% of that, so let's say 10% or 20%.\" Do you know what I mean? So doing that kind of analysis first before you pick your managers helps you decide where to be. For my clients, we're fairly confident we don't want to miss the rally. So we're more than, I'd say, more than halfway invested in the percentage we should have into equities, just an example.\n\nSo we're more than halfway in. And the way we're doing it is every month we're going to add another 5% to 10% in if we don't see any horrible signals telling us this is a nightmare. So we're going to kind of do it in a systematic way. That makes it a little bit less scary. But we reserve the right at any time to pull back, knowing that there will be tax consequences if you do that.\n\nForbes: Right but for now you're upping gradually, incrementally, your equities\n\nPepper: Gradually, incrementally, right, because we do think that it's a real rally. And we agree it will be sideways for a while. But let's say by the end of the year, nobody knows exactly when the smoke is going to clear. And everybody's going to say, \"OK, now it's going to really start running.\" Well, we want to be in there by the time that happens. Because what happens to a lot of people and I'm sure our behaviorist here will tell us, you know, people wait too long. They go in when it's at the top. And then they get killed. And then they sell when it's at the bottom. So we don't want to do that.\n\nSo we want to be kind of brave and keep gradually adding unless we see some piece of news that tells us there's something terrible that we're missing, right? So we're gradually getting back into our full position. And we're about halfway to our full equity position, just to give you an example.\n\nForbes: Are you interested in domestic equities or international equities?\n\nPepper: Both. Well again, every client has their own asset allocation, so both in domestic and international. We've seen a good sharp rally in the international markets. We haven't really talked about that. But again, I was just over in Asia for a month in all of March and a good part of April. They're not hit as hard as we are. Even though the markets went down very sharply, I think the recovery's going to come back there fairly well.\n\nSo again, we're kind of generally going, proceeding in cautiously and every month reserving the right to stop moving forward if the visibility doesn't improve. So with every little bit of improvement of visibility, I think you can put a little bit more in, to put it simplistically.\n\nForbes: OK, and Ron, what's your thought about the gradual upping of equity exposure over the next few months?\n\nRon Sloan: Well, you know, I have a much blunter term. I think dollar cost averaging is terrific. And that's, you know, in a period, especially, of uncertainty. But for the long-term positive view, I think it's a grand idea. I think what we're focusing on, I think I've said, I think we're probably going to go sideways for a while. I think what we continue to focus on or, you know, when you have had a huge collapse like we had over the last 18 months, even though we've had a small rally, these are times to significantly upgrade the quality in your portfolio in my view.\n\nSo we continue to focus on that and focus on basically self-sustaining businesses, that is, businesses that can fund their own growth, that don't need to go to the capital markets, that have strong cash flow and free cash-flow generation capabilities and that have significant pricing power. I don't know which way inflation, deflation goes. I think that, you know, having \"cut my eye teeth\" in this business in the '70s, I'm always leery of inflation. And I always think that left to its own devices, the government will always push more for inflation.\n\nIn fact, the re-flation story right now is part of what they want to accomplish. And the question is, \"Can they turn it off?\" And so, I think that businesses that have the ability to price in a cost of goods, the increases, are stronger businesses long-term. And those businesses really are not businesses focused on domestic markets. Those are businesses focused on, actually, international markets, because that's where the growth is.\n\nForbes: What are some of these businesses, may I ask?\n\nSloan: Well, technology and industrials, just to take a broad brush to it, would be those kinds of businesses.\n\nForbes: Names within those fields, there?\n\nSloan: Well, in international markets, businesses like ITT and Rockwell and Illinois Tool Works and names of that ilk would all be businesses that have decent pricing power, that sell very low-tolerance industrial goods that cannot be duplicated around the world, and that those international markets that are basically self-consuming more and more of their own output gap.\n\nIf it was low-quality manufacturing and therefore they need very high quality capital tools, those are the businesses you want to sell into. Also, you know, in India, of course, big service economy, we can continue to sell IT, hardware as well as software into those economies. And those are the businesses that therefore have pricing power, in my view.\n\nForbes: Would that include Cisco, for example?\n\nSloan: Cisco, Nokia, businesses of that ilk. These are household names, for the most part. We like smaller names like AMDOCS, which is a big software firm helping the telecommunications companies bill and allocate resources. So, there's a broad brush of technology industrial names that would be applicable.\n\nForbes: But Western names selling to the rest of the world?\n\nForbes: Quality Western names selling to places where they don't have similar quality?\n\nForbes: OK. And what you're saying about the cash flow, if they don't need government money or don't need to get financing, they can have the confidence to just go.\n\nPepper: Ron, there was a big article in, sorry to interrupt you, there. There's a big article and I'm sure you have a comment on this, Ron, on Home Depot ( HD - news - people ) vs. Lowes ( LOW - news - people ), which I thought was great in the Times, where Home Depot has basically said, \"We're just going to self-finance.\" They've cut back on their expansion plans. They're focusing on the store sales. And they're financing everything from internal cash flow.\n\nLowe's is still pursuing a growth at any cost kind of strategy. And it will be interesting to see at the end of the day who wins. But I think Home Depot has certainly shown it's adapting itself to the new realities.\n\nSloan: And especially in internal U.S. domestic markets, I think it's a much sounder strategy for that reason. I mean, they're trying to drive clear productivity through the existing four walls of their buildings as opposed to just square footage growth, which we would applaud.\n\nSee More Intelligent Investing Features", "summary": "Industrials and technology get our industry observers excited.", "density": 1.7777777778, "coverage": 0.8888888889000001, "compression": 284.5555555556, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0%2C8599%2C1584736%2C00.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2007020519id_/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1584736,00.html", "title": "Is Obama Black Enough?", "date": "2007020519", "text": "For all the predictable outrage Joe Biden's recent comments about Barack Obama elicited, the gaffe put a spotlight on one of the more unfortunate forces fueling Obamania. Ever since Barack Obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 Democratic convention, pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average Joe from the South Side. Obama is biracial, and has a direct connection with Africa. He is articulate, young and handsome. He does not feel the need to yell \"Reparations now!\" into any available microphone.\n\nBut this is a double-edged sword. As much as his biracial identity has helped Obama build a sizable following in middle America, it's also opened a gap for others to question his authenticity as a black man. In calling Obama the \"first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\" the implication was that the black people who are regularly seen by whites \u0097 or at least those who aspire to the highest office in the land \u0097 are none of these things. But give Biden credit \u0097 at least he acknowledged Obama's identity.\n\nThe same can't be said for others. \"Obama's mother is of white U.S. stock. His father is a black Kenyan,\" Stanley Crouch recently sniffed in a New York Daily News column entitled \"What Obama Isn't: Black Like Me.\" \"Black, in our political and social vocabulary, means those descended from West African slaves,\" wrote Debra Dickerson on the liberal website Salon. Writers like TIME and New Republic columnist Peter Beinart have argued that Obama is seen as a \"good black,\" and thus has less of following among black people. Meanwhile, agitators like Al Sharpton are seen as the authentic \"bad blacks.\" Obama's trouble, asserted Beinart, is that he will have to prove his loyalty to The People in a way that \"bad blacks\" never have to. Obama, for his part, settled this debate some time ago. \"If I'm outside your building trying to catch a cab,\" he told Charlie Rose, \"they're not saying, 'Oh, there's a mixed race guy.'\" Obama understands what all blacks, including myself, know all too well \u0097 that Amadou Diallo's foreign ancestry could not prevent his wallet from morphing into a gun in the eyes of the police.\n\nFor years pundits excoriated young black kids for attacking other smart successful black kids by questioning their blackness. But this is suddenly permissible for presidential candidates. Beinart's good black/bad black dynamic is the sort of armchair logic that comes from not spending much time around actual black people. As the New Republic points out, Sharpton has an overstated following among black people. In 2004, when Sharpton ran for President, his traction among his alleged base was underwhelming. In South Carolina, where almost half of all registered Dems were black, both John Kerry and John Edwards received twice as many black votes as Sharpton. But this hasn't stopped media outlets from phoning Sharpton whenever something even remotely racial goes down. And it hasn't stopped writers from touting Sharpton's presumed popularity among black people, as opposed to \"palatable\" black people like Obama.\n\nThe black-on-black argument seemed to be bolstered by recent polls showing Obama significantly trailing Hillary Clinton among black voters. But reading into poll numbers that way is a clever device, hatched by mainstream (primarily white) journalists who are shocked \u0097 shocked! \u0097 to discover that black people aren't as dumbstruck by Obama as they are.\n\nWhat they fail to understand is that African-Americans meet other intelligent, articulate African-Americans all the time. In almost every cycle since 1984, at least one of these brave chaps has run for President. Forgive us if we don't automatically pledge our votes to Obama and instead make judgments based on things besides skin color \u0097 like, heaven forbid, issues. Joe Biden may have misspoken \u0097 and in the process probably destroyed any remote hopes of winning the nomination \u0097 but he spoke truthfully for a lot of his ilk; Obamania is rooted in the belief that 50 Cent, not Barack Obama, represents the real black America.\n\nBack in the real world, Obama is married to a black woman. He goes to a black church. He's worked with poor people on the South Side of Chicago, and still lives there. That someone given the escape valve of biraciality would choose to be black, would see some beauty in his darker self and still care more about health care and public education than reparations and Confederate flags is just too much for many small-minded racists, both black and white, to comprehend.\n\nBarack Obama's real problem isn't that he's too white \u0097 it's that he's too black.", "summary": "Viewpoint: Biden's comment was rooted in the myth that the Senator doesn't represent the", "density": 1.2941176471, "coverage": 0.7058823529, "compression": 55.1176470588, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/airport-security-guns-teargas-1.3701532", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2016073119id_/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/airport-security-guns-teargas-1.3701532", "title": "Passengers try to fly out of Canadian airports with tear gas, blades, Tasers, guns and drugs", "date": "2016073119", "text": "It should be no surprise to anyone who has travelled through an airport that there are some common-sense restrictions on what we are allowed to bring along in our carry-on baggage.\n\nThings such as meat cleavers, shotguns, rifles, handguns, live bullets and all manner of butterfly knives, switchblades and, yes, even throwing stars are all items we should leave at home with our far more benign household items.\n\nBut do passengers really need to be told to leave these dangerous weapons behind? After Sept. 11, 2001, saw hijackers take down four planes with box-cutters, it should be more than obvious that these objects are a no-no, right? Apparently not.\n\nThrough access to information requests, CBC News has obtained a list of items seized or identified as potentially dangerous by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) at airports across the country from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2015. Here's a look at ten of the most interesting incidents:\n\nThere were many instances of passengers trying to take grenade-looking items through airport security, but in most cases they simply turned out to be lighters. In one instance, however, the grenade turned out to be an inert grenade.\n\nIn another incident, a passenger was caught at Toronto Pearson International Airport with a grenade-shaped item that turned out not to be a lighter, but rather a marijuana grinder shaped like the projectile. The device was seized and the passenger was allowed to board the plane.\n\nOfficials at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport searched a passenger's bag after a scan revealed what appeared to be firearm.\n\nPolice and screening personnel discovered the item to be a spear gun, which was then allowed to remain in the passenger's checked bag, and the passenger was cleared to board.\n\nLive bullets are one of the most common seizures at airport security, so it's no surprise officials at the Trudeau Airport wanted to search the carry-on luggage of a passenger who appeared to be carrying them.\n\nWhen police searched the bag they found not only eight live bullets but three flares as well. The items were seized by police and the passenger was cleared to board their flight.\n\nScreening authorities in Montreal also conducted a search of a passenger's bag when an X-ray appeared to show a saw blade concealed within. The search did not turn up a saw blade, but it did reveal a \"small\" amount of weed.\n\nWhile it may be illegal to possess marijuana, especially when trying to clear airport security, law enforcement officials simply seized the drug, warned the passenger and then cleared him to board his flight.\n\nScreeners at Vancouver International Airport called in law enforcement when they discovered what appeared to be a shotgun in someone's carry-on luggage.\n\nSure enough, when the bag was searched, screeners found a 12-gauge shotgun, which had been declared. The problem was that the passenger misunderstood the boarding instructions and, instead of checking the gun with their luggage, they tried to bring it on the plane.\n\nPolice escorted the passenger back to where he could check in the gun, and he was then allowed to board the plane.\n\nIn another case, screeners at Calgary International Airport found six antique rifles, which were then properly declared and the passenger was allowed to board.\n\nOfficials at Pearson ordered a passenger's carry-on luggage to be searched when an X-ray of it appeared to reveal a canister of mace concealed within.\n\nThe item turned out to be a container of prohibited tear gas, which was then seized by police. The passenger was allowed to board the plane.\n\nScreeners in Montreal operating the X-ray machine noticed a passenger was carrying a sword cane in their checked baggage. Police were called and the item was judged to not be a prohibited item so long as it remained in the passenger's checked baggage. The passenger was cleared to board.\n\nAlong with live bullets, it seems as though some of the most popular items to try to sneak through airport security are blades. There were countless incident reports for people carrying throwing knives, ninja throwing stars, switchblades, meat cleavers and kitchen knives.\n\nIn almost all cases, the blades were confiscated by security officials and the passenger was then allowed to board their flight.\n\nSecurity screeners at Calgary International Airport called in law enforcement when they discovered a passenger appeared to be transporting a gun in their carry-on luggage.\n\nWhen the bag was searched, it turned out to be a pellet gun. The weapon was seized by police and the passenger was allowed to board their flight.\n\nScreeners at Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport stopped a pilot from boarding a plane he was scheduled to fly when they discovered a suspicious item in his bag.\n\nThe item was removed from the bag and appeared to be nothing more than a flashlight. A screener even managed to turn on the light. But a more senior official, familiar with the way a Taser could be hidden in this device, stepped in and revealed its true purpose.\n\nPolice confiscated the Taser and, after answering a few questions, the pilot was allowed to resume his duties.", "summary": "Through Access to Information, CBC News obtained a list of items seized or identified as potentially dangerous at airports across the country from Jan. 1, 2015, to Dec. 31, 2015.", "density": 7.1714285714, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 28.7714285714, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://mashable.com/2016/11/04/bill-simmons-cancelled/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2016110419id_/http://mashable.com/2016/11/04/bill-simmons-cancelled/", "title": "Bill Simmons' 'Any Given Wednesday' is over after four months", "date": "2016110419", "text": "That was a short run.\n\nBill Simmons' weekly HBO talk show \"Any Given Wednesday\" has been cancelled after only fourth months on the air.

As founders, heads and CEOs of some of Africa\u2019s largest media conglomerates, they shape opinions and inspire thought processes through their varied multi-media interests. They are Africa\u2019s answers to the likes of Rupert Murdoch, Sumner Redstone or Ted Turner.\n\nThese are the five most powerful media moguls in Africa:\n\nThe 59 year-old South African is easily Africa\u2019s most powerful media mogul. As CEO and the largest individual shareholder of Naspers, a $12 billion (market cap) media conglomerate, Bekker controls 23 magazines (including YOU, Drum and True Love), 7 newspapers, pay-TV giant DSTV, and Brazilian publisher Abril. Bekker believes the future of media lies online. He has spent hundreds of millions gobbling up significant stakes in some of the web\u2019s most valued internet outfits, including a 30% stake in London-listed Russian Internet giant, Mail.ru. Naspers also owns stakes in 24.com, Mxit Lifestyle and QQ. He has been chief executive of Naspers since 1997.\n\nThe Kenyan national heads East Africa\u2019s largest media conglomerate, the Nairobi Stock Exchange-listed Nation Media Group (NMG). The $350 million (market cap) conglomerate owns 7 newspapers, including Daily Nation, the region\u2019s highest-circulating daily newspaper. NMG\u2019s other assets include 3 television and 3 radio stations, as well as mobile value added services and Internet companies across Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Gitahi holds an MBA from the United States International University, Kenya.\n\nA trained Chartered accountant, Mengi is one of Africa\u2019s most revered media moguls, and one of Tanzania\u2019s most influential men. The IPP Group, which he founded in the mid 1980s, owns 10 national newspapers (including Tanzania\u2019s Financial Times, ThisDay and The Guardian), two of East Africa\u2019s most popular Television stations (EATV and ITV), and about ten radio stations.\n\nDesai heads Avusa, a South African media conglomerate that owns 16 newspapers (including Business Day, Sunday Times) 9 magazines, Cinemas (NuMetro), a record label (Gallo) and numerous retail outlets. Prakash, who was appointed chief executive in 2006, serves as a board member of the World Association of Newspapers and is president of trade association Print Media South Africa.\n\nObaigbena, 52, is the chairman of Leaders & Company, which publishes ThisDay, easily Nigeria\u2019s most influential newspaper. Obaigbena has often been the subject of intense criticism by local and international media for his closeness to politicians, particularly those of the ruling People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP). In April, an Al-Jazeera Television programme indirectly referred to Obaigbena as a corrupt journalist who blackmailed public officials for financial compensation. He refuted the allegations; Al-Jazeera issued an apology shortly afterwards.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @EmperorDIV", "summary": "They might not be household names, but these 5 individuals are probably the most dominant forces in African media.", "density": 7.0952380952, "coverage": 0.9047619048000001, "compression": 26.8571428571, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/middleeast/24amman.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2010022419id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/middleeast/24amman.html", "title": "Sidewalks, and an Identity, Sprout in Jordan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Capital", "date": "2010022419", "text": "AMMAN, Jordan \u2014 It might be too much to call it a miracle, but the government of this ancient metropolis that rolls out over seven sun-burned hills has managed something that until now seemed impossible. It built sidewalks that are easy to walk on.\n\nBut wait, Amman has achieved something else, too! It has put in park benches. And not just in parks, but right there, on those new, flat sidewalks that do not end suddenly, for no apparent reason. Sidewalks and benches are easy to dismiss as discretionary conveniences, unnecessary urban flourishes. That is especially true considering how people here need so much \u2014 better jobs, better schools and better health care.\n\nBut to talk to those behind the sidewalks and the benches is to see these ubiquitous objects as powerful tools of social planning, tearing down walls between rich and poor, helping a city bereft of an identity develop a sense of place and ownership.\n\n\u201cI think it made people a little happier,\u201d said Omar al-Deeb, 68, who grew up in the less wealthy East Amman side of the city.\n\nMr. Deeb sells shoes and sandals in a tightly packed neighborhood where shops and homes, mosques and churches all cling to the sides of a hill, linked by narrow, winding streets. His workplace is a plastic chair on the corner of Al Taj Street and Bader Street, right next to one of the city\u2019s latest innovations, a pedestrian walkway with trees and benches. A street once clogged with cars is now a place where families from a side of town that often felt ignored by the government have benches to sit on.\n\n\u201cEverybody likes it,\u201d said Ahmed Sosa, 38, owner of a nut shop just off the new square that opened this month.\n\nThese are not one-time projects, a few benches here and there, but part of a master plan for Amman, an attempt to bring order to a city with roots that date from 8500 B.C. and whose modern incarnation hosts 2.5 million residents, 3 million in the summer. Amman\u2019s master plan has a slogan \u2014 \u201cA livable city is an organized city, with a soul\u201d \u2014 a subtle way of describing what Amman does not want to be, which is Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe were facing Dubaification,\u201d said Gerry Post, a Canadian who is president and founder of the Amman Institute for Urban Development, a team of mostly Jordanian architects, urban planners, designers and thinkers created by Mayor Omar Maani to help restore, rather than reinvent, Amman.\n\nWhen Mr. Maani was appointed four years ago, there were plans to build 16 glass and steel towers along a main road of Amman, towers that would block out the vista of white houses carpeting the hills. The tallest was to be 80 stories. The towers would have strained the infrastructure, but more troublesome to the urban planners, they would have created islands of privilege for the very rich.\n\nThe projects were relocated to three low points around the city, preserving the skyline and a sense of community, along with the much needed investment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want two cities in one,\u201d said Rami F. Daher, the architect and urban reinventor behind some of the city\u2019s most subtle and yet most audacious projects.\n\nIn Mr. Daher\u2019s world, benches matter, as do sidewalks.\n\n\u201cMost important of all is social diversity and justice,\u201d Mr. Daher said, sounding more like a political activist than a planner.\n\nJordan\u2019s political system makes change difficult. Like many others in the Arab world, it offers a veneer of democracy that in the end yields to one central power, in this case the monarchy. The urban planners see a chance to empower citizens by changing the spaces around them, but by first asking how they want to live. They do surveys, and Mr. Post has trained staff to hold community meetings.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s lacking in the city is a sense of citizenship,\u201d Mr. Post said. \u201cWe have to create a sense of citizenship as well as stewardship.\u201d\n\nJordan has grown with each wave of immigrants \u2014 Circassians, Armenians, Lebanese and Palestinians. Later, Jordanians who lived in smaller villages and cities moved to Amman, helping it develop into an economic, political and cultural center. But no matter how many generations later, people rarely identify as being from Amman, many people here said.

Staked to leads of 3-0 and 4-2 on Saturday, Burnett could not hold them. He was yanked with two runners on and no outs in the fourth, making it his shortest outing of the season.\n\nIn five June starts, Burnett is 0-5 with an earned run average of 11.35. In his last three, the carnage is even worse: 19 runs, 21 hits and 12 walks in 13 innings, producing a 16.55 E.R.A. On Saturday, he threw more balls (41) than strikes (38).\n\nWhether his struggles are tied to absent command, the absence of the pitching coach Dave Eiland, a combination of things or something else entirely, the Yankees realize the importance of fixing Burnett and fixing him quickly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of finding me out there,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cThe results were terrible again, like I said, but I felt a little better, believe it or not.\u201d\n\nAfter his last start, Monday night in Phoenix, and again on Friday, Burnett said he was he encouraged because he knew how to correct his flaws. He could not slow down the game. He felt awkward pitching out of the windup, something he rarely did Saturday: Of the 20 batters he faced, 12 reached base, even though Burnett felt like he had \u201cunbelievable stuff.\u201d\n\nWhen Javier Vazquez struggled earlier this season, the Yankees skipped a start so he could work in the bullpen with Eiland, who has been away from the team for three weeks because of personal reasons. Back then, they could manipulate their rotation to maximize time off for Vazquez. Their schedule does not allow it this time, and Manager Joe Girardi, calling it a \u201cgut feeling,\u201d said he wanted Burnett to keep pitching through his troubles. Burnett said he appreciated Girardi\u2019s confidence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily going to benefit from it right now, I don\u2019t,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cWe need A. J., and A. J. has the ability to pitch well, and I believe he\u2019s going to pitch well.\u201d\n\nIdentifying the source of his problems has become a teamwide endeavor, with everyone from the bench coach Tony Pena to catcher Jorge Posada offering advice between starts. Burnett watched videotape from his successful 2008 season with Toronto to compare his mechanics, and determined that he was not tipping pitches, as was feared. But he detected something else: His front shoulder was opening too soon, diminishing his control and affecting his deception.\n\nBurnett\u2019s miseries began June 4, the day Eiland left the team. Girardi acknowledged the possibility that Burnett, more so than the Yankees\u2019 other starters, could benefit from a consistent pitching coach. But he adamantly defended the interim pitching coach Mike Harkey, and Burnett accepted responsibility for his troubles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pitched 10 years without Dave also, so we\u2019re not pointing fingers at nobody but No. 34,\u201d Burnett said, referring to his jersey number.\n\nFor now, the best the Yankees might be hoping for is incremental progress. A good start would be a clean first inning. Burnett\u2019s troubles on Saturday, as they often have, began immediately. After Mark Teixeira\u2019s three-run homer put the Yankees ahead, 3-0, Burnett responded by giving up a leadoff single to Rafael Furcal. Two more hits, including a ground-rule double by Manny Ramirez, and a sacrifice fly followed, and the Dodgers trailed, 3-2.\n\nIn first innings, Burnett has a 7.31 E.R.A. He fares even worse in the third (9.56), when the top of the lineup often hits for a second time.\n\nWith no outs in the third, Burnett loaded the bases on two walks and a single (and a wild pitch) before James Loney ripped a single through the right side, tying the score at 4-4. A walk to Casey Blake reloaded the bases for Russell Martin, just as Boone Logan started warming up.\n\nBurnett was glad to trade a run for two outs when Martin grounded into a double play, and he escaped further damage by striking out pitcher Hiroki Kuroda. But Burnett did not retire another batter, and the Yankees were left to hope that they win the next time he does.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing everything he can, but it\u2019s just not clicking right now,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cThat happens. It\u2019s life. Obviously we\u2019d like to get our players and put a computer chip in their head, but this is life. There are struggles in life, and you\u2019ve got to fight.\u201d\n\nAnother day went by Saturday without a summit between Joe Torre and Alex Rodriguez, who said he never saw Torre on Friday to greet him. Torre was pleased when he was told that Rodriguez complimented him, saying he influenced his success as a hitter. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that because I didn\u2019t think there was any issue that would keep us from saying hello,\u201d Torre said before Saturday\u2019s game. ... Manager Joe Girardi said the injured relievers Sergio Mitre and Alfredo Aceves were scheduled to throw off a mound Monday in Tampa, Fla., a precursor to minor league rehabilitation assignments. ... Derek Jeter turned 36 Saturday. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, only two players since 1961 have accumulated more hits before their 36th birthdays than Jeter, who has 2,834: Hank Aaron (2,956) and Robin Yount (2,868).", "summary": "A.J.

(CBC)\n\nGallant brushed off the Tory attacks during his party's campaign launch, which started at his campaign headquarters for the riding of Shediac Bay-Dieppe.\n\n\"It's not surprising,\" said Gallant. \"What have they been focused on for the last four years? Cutting arbitrarily, and fracking. Where has that got us? Three thousand nine hundred less jobs than we had in July 2010,\" he said.\n\n\"Under the Alward Conservatives we have seen a fixation on cuts. Unfortunately, they cut in a very non-strategic way. They didn't realize that when they were cutting they could depress the economy even more,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThey didn't realize they would hurt ordinary New Brunswickers who were finding life less affordable. And they didn't realize that despite the fact that they were doing these cuts they wouldn't be able to balance the books.\"\n\nGallant said a Liberal government would change economic development. The province needs to diversify and be strategic, he said. The Liberals would support four major energy projects: an LNG export terminal, an oil export facility, the Energy East pipeline, as well as Sisson Brook and other new mining opportunities, he said.\n\nGallant also promised to better co-ordinate job creation efforts, measure the successes and failures of those responsible for creating jobs, and ensure accountability is brought back to create the environment he said is necessary to help businesses start up and grow.\n\nOther Liberal priorities include tourism and immigration, education training and literacy, a tax increase to top one per cent of income earners in the province and a reversal of 2012 business tax break, Gallant said.\n\nNDP Party Dominic Cardy says New Brunswickers now have a choice for change after 150 years of the Tories and Liberals. (CBC)\n\n\u200bNDP Leader Dominic Cardy is hoping voters will opt for change over the two traditional parties.\n\n\"What they lack is the ability to make that change real,\" Cardy said during his campaign launch, which was held at his party headquarters on Regent Street in Fredericton.\n\n\"They lack the ability to give New Brunswick the government it deserves because they continue to listen to special interests and people in their backrooms who will constantly draw them away from what the public wants and direct them towards decisions that only benefit a very small number of people. That's what we're going to change because New Brunswick deserves better,\" he said.\n\n\"We're here to talk about realistic, practical change for New Brunswick.\"\n\nThe NDP is committed to creating the best education system to give New Brunswickers the tools they need to become highest trained workers in the world and citizens of best place in the world to live, said Cardy, who is running in Fredericton West-Hanwell.\n\nSome of the party's other priorities include eliminating patronage from government, fixing the health care system, lifting rural communities out of poverty and giving an equal voice to all communities, he said.\n\n\"There is now a real choice.

It was set up in response to the trebling of tuition fees and a perceived weakness at the time of the National Union of Students (NUS).

For three days I agonized as the horrific events occurred, from the Charlie Hebdo massacre to the nightmare of an ending that left hostages dead at a Jewish market. As an American, I grieved for senseless French, Muslim, and Jewish deaths. As a parent, I feared for my child\u2019s safety in an increasingly frightening world.\n\nMy family has grown up with terror. On Sept. 11, 2001, a plane soared above my head as I was walking near my home in Greenwich Village, inexplicably flying so low. Moments later it barreled into the first Twin Tower. I watched from an NYU roof as the first building burned, incredulously asking others nearby, \u201cIs there really a plane inside?\u201d Running back to my daughter\u2019s second grade classroom, 25 blocks north, I saw the second tower implode. As I doubled over, breaking into sobs, a stranger put his hand on my shoulder to console me. For months afterwards I had panic attacks and difficulty sleeping at night.\n\nMy 7-year-old kept asking if she was safe. I\u2019d say \u201cyes,\u201d for the first time knowing I couldn\u2019t always protect her. She drew pictures of planes crashing into buildings. Her classmate\u2019s uncle was a firefighter who died that awful morning. In creative writing classes in college, she still reflects how that day impacted her life. She recalls her city of birth turning into a nightmare: showing identification to enter our neighborhood, wearing masks while walking through polluted streets, sleeping on the floor of the living room to minimize the burning smells for months. Then, defying some predictions, New York City evolved into such a safe place that my teenage daughter took the subway home alone late at night. She\u2019s not used to looking suspiciously over her shoulder, fearing terrorism in a temple or kosher store.\n\nI grew up during the air raid drills of the 1950\u2032s, when we were diving beneath our desks. My daughter was privy to school lock-downs during more than 20 school shootings nationwide since Columbine. I fret over whether to let her feel confident in our unsettling world, or to instill enough fear to make her afraid enough to be cautious. This protective parenting conflict was always a bit abstract\u2014until Paris.\n\nShe fell in love with French in middle school. Later she studied Arabic, which I encouraged, committed to the idea that our global world problems might be better addressed if more of us shared the same languages. A friend who is the child of Holocaust survivors had a different opinion, initially bristling when I mentioned my daughter\u2019s Arabic studies.\n\nNow just hours after the Paris terrorist attacks and minutes before the scanners would examine my daughter\u2019s carry-on luggage, I blurt out, \u201cHave a few sentences ready in Arabic just in case you ever feel threatened.\u201d\n\nAlthough France is on its highest terror alert, I\u2019ve been on high Jewish mother alert since last summer, when anti-Semitic incidents became prevalent in Paris and other parts of Europe. \u201cMaybe you should think about studying abroad somewhere else,\u201d I suggested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dreamt about the Sorbonne since ninth grade,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you worry too much.\u201d\n\nI was afraid she worried too little. \u201cDon\u2019t go into any synagogues,\u201d I said, feeling guilty asking her to hide her religious background, even though she was raised as a secular Jew. She has always lived peacefully among a multitude of races, religions, and gender identities. But my friend tells me that today\u2019s anti-Semitism in Europe is chillingly reminiscent of Nazi Germany.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell your host family you speak Arabic,\u201d I warn my daughter on the airport security line. \u201cNot until you feel out their opinions. There\u2019s a lot of anti-Muslim sentiment right now in Paris.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want her to hide her Jewish roots or abandon her quest to understand Arabic culture. I do want her to continue to embrace her open-mindedness toward people who don\u2019t look or act like her. It\u2019s a gift to be young and eager to understand\u2014rather than to be suspicious and even hateful. But I\u2019m also a mother who wants my child to be safe.\n\nAnd so I follow the advice of the U.S. Embassy in Paris that it\u2019s fine to travel, convinced the Air France jet will land on runways that had just reopened after taking precautions during the shoot out.

But their commencement celebration came in the midst of reports of widespread sexual assault throughout the military, and Obama ended his 20-minute address by recognizing \"how the misconduct of some can have effects that ripple far and wide.\"\n\n\"Those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong,\" Obama said. \"That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes, because they've got no place in the greatest military on Earth.\"\n\nHis pointed comments were aimed at rooting out the problem at a time when Republicans have been criticizing Obama for not responding forcefully enough to controversies including last year's deadly attack in Libya and political targeting at the IRS. But Obama was quick to express outrage over the reports of sexual assault, saying he has no tolerance for it. He summoned military leaders to the White House last week and instructed them to lead a process to root out the problem.\n\nThe Pentagon released a report earlier this month estimating that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs. That figure is an increase over the 19,000 estimated assaults in 2011.\n\nSeveral recent arrests have added to the military's embarrassment. A soldier at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point was charged with secretly photographing women, including in a bathroom. The Air Force officer who led the service's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response unit was arrested on charges of groping a woman. And the manager of the Army's sexual assault response program at Fort Campbell, Ky., was relieved of his post after his arrest in a domestic dispute with his ex-wife.\n\nThe applause that had accompanied earlier portions of Obama's Naval Academy speech, as he mentioned the Navy Seal's killing of Osama bin Laden and called for the building of a powerful 300-ship fleet, fell to silence as he turned to the sexual assault scandal. Midshipmen and spectators watching under cool gray skies as a light rain fell listened silently as he repeated the refrain: \"We need your honor.\"\n\nObama urged the graduates to use the leadership skills and values learned at the academy to help prevent behavior in the battlefield that can damage the image of the U.S. overseas.\n\n\"We need your honor, that inner compass that guides you, not when the path is easy and obvious, but it's hard and uncertain, that tells you the difference between that which is right and that which is wrong,\" Obama said. \"Perhaps it will be the moment when you think nobody's watching. But never forget that honor, like character, is what you do when nobody's looking.\"\n\nAfter the midshipmen took their oath of office as Navy ensigns and Marine second lieutenants, the president emerged from the covered stage into the rain to shake the hand of each graduate collecting a diploma. \"Folks in the Navy don't mind a little water,\" the president joked in his speech. The rain stopped just before the whooping graduates threw their caps in the air to end the ceremony.\n\nObama's address was the second to a military audience in as many days, coming a day after he laid out his counterterrorism vision at the National Defense University where he defended his controversial drone strikes program and renewed his push to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility.\n\nIt's a tradition for presidents to rotate speeches at the commissioning ceremonies of the four service academies. The Naval Academy, about 30 miles from the White House in Annapolis, Md., says 16 presidents have addressed graduates, and Obama is the sixth to do so twice. He also addressed 2009 graduates.\n\nThe ceremony and its pageantry could not escape Washington's budget fights. The Navy's Blue Angels aerobatic team won't perform because of budget cuts due to a fight between Obama and congressional Republicans.\n\nBut the ceremony also featured a fitting achievement: For the first time in the academy's history, an entire family will have graduated from the school.\n\nMatt Disher was joining his brother Brett and sister Alison, twins who graduated in 2010, as well as his father Tim and mother Sharon as alumni.\n\n\"Tim and I never expected anything like this,\" said Sharon, who graduated in 1980 in the first class that included women. \"In fact, if anything we probably discouraged the kids from going, because if you don't come in for the right reason, which is to serve your country, you're not going to last.\"\n\nSharon Disher, of Annapolis, wrote the book \"First Class: Women Join the Ranks at the Naval Academy\" about the difficulties of being in the class of 1980, the first that included women. She said she's disappointed the military is still grappling with sexual assault issues but applauded the president for raising the subject.\n\n\"The more we talk about it, the more we're going to do something about it, and that's the thing we never did,\" she said. \"I guess we've just got to keep the conversation going until we fix the problem.\"", "summary": "President Obama is scheduled to speak at the U.S. Naval Academy's graduation.", "density": 1.5, "coverage": 0.7857142857, "compression": 77.9285714286, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/world/asia/india-primary-school-system-uttar-pradesh.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2016022019id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/world/asia/india-primary-school-system-uttar-pradesh.html", "title": "Fighting Truancy Among India\u2019s Teachers, With a Pistol and a Stick", "date": "2016022019", "text": "DEORIA, India \u2014 The young man, having skipped school, was there to plead his case, but Manoj Mishra was having none of it. When the truant offered a letter from a relative of a government minister pleading for leniency, Mr. Mishra grabbed it and, with a frown, tore it in half and dropped it to the floor.\n\nSimilar scenes played out repeatedly in Mr. Mishra\u2019s fluorescent-lit office recently, as one truant after another appeared before him, trying to explain an absence from school.\n\nBut these were not students who had been pulled in for truancy. They were teachers.\n\nMr. Mishra, a district education officer in India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, is fighting one of the biggest obstacles to improving the largest primary school system in the world: absent teachers. His tough punishments and refusal to back down, chronicled in the local newspapers, have turned him into a folk hero. As he walks along the dusty streets of the wheat-farming villages a couple of hours\u2019 drive from Nepal, older people touch his feet in a sign of respect. Young women pull out their phones and take selfies by his side.\n\nWhen Mr. Mishra arrived in Deoria in 2014, 40 percent of the district\u2019s teachers were absent on any given day from its 2,700 schools, he said in a recent interview. Nationwide, nearly 24 percent of rural Indian teachers were absent during random visits for a recent study led by Karthik Muralidharan at the University of California, San Diego. Teacher absences run as high as 46 percent in some states.\n\nMR. MISHRA says that teacher attendance has soared to above 90 percent, about the best that can be expected considering sickness and personal matters.\n\nAchieving that attendance record has not been easy. Teachers have threatened to shoot Mr. Mishra, roughed him up, turned his desk upside down and loudly denounced him in protests outside his office. Their allies, including ministers and legislators, have made phone calls and visits, demanding he ease up.\n\nMr. Mishra, 42, has responded by packing a loaded pistol in his right front pocket, hiring private security guards and putting cameras in his office.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the first anyone had met like him, a government officer so bold and unbending,\u201d said Pratap Pathak, a reporter for Dainik Jagran, a Hindi daily.\n\nWith the largest population in the world under the age of 35, India is trying to grow by leveraging what is often called the \u201cdemographic dividend.\u201d To prepare more than 200 million primary school children for jobs in a modern work force, India passed legislation a decade ago that more than doubled education spending, increased teacher salaries and reduced class sizes.\n\nBut children\u2019s already low performance has fallen. Pratham Education Foundation, a nonprofit that conducts an annual household survey, reported that in 2005 about 60 percent of fifth graders in rural India \u2014 where most people live \u2014 could read at a minimum second-grade level, but that in 2014 less than 50 percent could.\n\nTeacher truancy is among the more prominent causes of that failure, experts say. Teaching jobs pay well and are sometimes obtained through political connections. But those who get them often do not want to travel to the remote areas where many schools are. In areas with weak local governance, not showing up has become the norm, and people feel powerless to complain.\n\nThat is where Mr. Mishra comes in. Wearing a shiny gray jacket, and with a halo of wavy black hair around a chubby-cheeked face, he hardly looks the tough guy. He grew up in a village about 100 miles away, attending a school similar to the ones he now oversees. Having graduated from this state\u2019s prestigious Allahabad University, he joined the state Civil Service, landing a coveted education post in 2002. After jobs in the state education headquarters, he moved out into the field as the officer in charge of primary education in district after district.\n\nBy August 2014, when he showed up in Deoria, he was already causing a stir. He had been reprimanded for beating up three teachers with a stick because he believed they had landed their jobs using fraudulent documents. That episode made the headlines in the nearby city of Gorakhpur.\n\n\u201cWherever he was, there was always a conversation around him,\u201d said Mr. Pathak, the newspaper reporter.\n\nJust a few days into the Deoria job, Mr. Mishra began to get text messages from people complaining that teachers rarely attended school. By then, he was well aware that widespread teacher truancy could occur only if, he said, \u201cmy officers are hand in glove with the teachers,\u201d warning them if anyone was coming to check attendance.\n\nSome weeks later, he called all the officers to a meeting, collected their cellphones and sent them out to schools they were not in charge of supervising to report on absences.\n\nThe results shocked him. In one subdistrict, 73 of its 245 teachers were absent.\n\nMr. Mishra said he soon discovered that some of the missing teachers lived nowhere near their schools. One lived in the New Delhi suburb of Noida, a two-hour flight from the Deoria area; another in India\u2019s financial capital, Mumbai, more than a thousand miles away. Another had not been seen in school for six years.\n\nHe says many of them worked other jobs and had bribed his officers into reporting them present.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I took the problem seriously and realized I needed to do something about it,\u201d Mr. Mishra said.\n\nA principal, Manoj Singh, 40, was among those nabbed in the first raid. Soon after, Mr. Mishra demoted him to assistant teacher, cutting his monthly salary of $750 by one-third, and transferred him to a remote village a two hours\u2019 drive from his home.\n\nMR. SINGH said he was sure he could persuade Mr. Mishra to forgive him because \u201ceveryone had missed school for years and no officers had ever come down hard on anyone.\u201d\n\nHe told Mr. Mishra that he was sick on the day of the attendance check, and even persuaded politicians and union leaders to intervene on his behalf.\n\n\u201cDo whatever you want,\u201d he said Mr. Mishra told him. \u201cI have done what I have to.\u201d\n\nIn his frustration, Mr. Singh acknowledged, \u201cI got aggressive. It\u2019s possible I said some loose words.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Mishra\u2019s telling, the former principal threatened to shoot him.\n\nMr. Singh said he does not recall making such a threat, but whatever he said, it was enough for Mr. Mishra to go to the police.\n\nMr. Mishra said he received hundreds of calls and visits on behalf of virtually all of the suspended teachers. \u201cThere was mayhem,\u201d said Sunil Singh, a reporter for another Hindi daily, Amar Ujala.\n\nMost people, Mr. Mishra included, believed that he would be transferred within a week, the usual punishment from the state executive for disobedient officers. But the tide turned in his favor. \u201cEveryone except the teachers was happy with his work,\u201d Mr. Pathak said.\n\nIt did not hurt that the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party had swept to victory not long before with the promise of fighting corruption. One day, Ram Govind Choudhary, then the state basic education minister, called Mr. Mishra and said, \u201cI support you \u2014 don\u2019t worry,\u201d both men recalled.\n\n\u201cWhat he did is what all my district officers should do,\u201d Mr. Choudhary said in an interview.\n\nEmboldened, Mr. Mishra began leading raids on the schools each month. He set up a toll-free number to report truant teachers, and painted it on every school wall.\n\nLocals watched gleefully on the days the schools were inspected, when streams of teachers could be seen sprinting across town trying to reach their classrooms before Mr. Mishra and his officers could get there.\n\nMr. Mishra says making teachers go to school is only one small step forward.\n\n\u201cWhether they teach or don\u2019t teach, I can\u2019t tell,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, at least, they come to school.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on February 20, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Truant Teachers in India, Meet Your Worst Nightmare .

Not only does that make them a worthwhile group to target for advertisers, but Hispanic millennials are more active on digital media than any other group, especially on social media and mobile device activity. Popsugar Latina has already found a sponsor: J.C. Penney.\n\nRead MoreThe new power of millennial Hispanics\n\nThe way to capture Hispanic millennial attention is to use technology, which is why many media companies are adding new digital experiences specifically for this market, said Marla Skiko, executive vice president and director of digital innovation at Starcom MediaVest Group's multicultural division. While television still reigns supreme, Skiko pointed out that especially when it comes to Hispanic millennials, more marketers are searching for ways to complement their television advertising with online campaigns.\n\n\"We haven't had a year where digital advertising spending toward the Hispanic market has been down,\" Skiko said.\n\nWhat's encouraging even more marketers to reach out to Latinas more is that they no longer have to create bilingual campaigns. According to agency Sensis and ThinkNow Research's The Hispanic Millennial Project, about 56 percent of Hispanic millennials were born in the U.S.\u2014a trend Popsugar also noticed among its site visitors.\n\nWhile Popsugar Latina will be targeted to the young Latina, it will be in English. Content will include topics like celebrity gossip, Hispanic recipes, fitness and fashion. Because it is mobile-friendly, items will be shorter, \"stackable\" content. And, although many of the stories will be bespoke for the section, it can also appear anywhere else on the Popsguar site.\n\n\"Our intent is to deliver the content in English, focusing on content for the Latina who considers herself to be 100 percent American and 100 percent Latina,\" Fieler said. \"It's the second generation Latina for who English is a native language, but she's still tied to her culture.\"\n\nRead MoreA bigger, better consumer market than millennials\n\nEven television has been getting in on the digital action. Univision Deportes and Snapchat worked together to broadcast highlights from the April USA-Mexico soccer match on Snapchat. NBCUniversal has been experimenting with various new technologies to reach the Hispanic millennial.\n\n\"What is really important about the Hispanic millennial market is that they are very engaged consumers,\" said Peter Blacker, executive vice president of digital media and emerging business at NBCUniversal. \"They are very engaged consumers. They are also high tech consumers and high touch.\"\n\nFor example, Blacker pointed out that NBCUniversal found that Hispanic millennials on average watched 34 more minutes of online video than non-Hispanic millennials, and were also five times more likely to share digital content than their counterparts.\n\nNBCUniversal's Double Action app creates a second screen experience on mobile that is concurrent with what is happening on television. During one episode of Telemundo's telenovela El Se\u00f1or de los Cielos, one of the main characters gets in a car chase. While linear TV viewers will see the hero in his car talking on his phone with the windows up, those who have downloaded the Double Action app will get a video call from the protagonist himself and hear the conversation.\n\nIt's also experimenting with virtual reality through RAVE, or its real-time augmented virtual experience. The technology will help bring Hispanic millennials closer to the red carpets during top Industry events like the Latin Billboard Awards and Telemundo's \"Premios Tu Mundo\" award show.\n\nBoth digital initiatives are open to for advertiser sponsorship.\n\n\"The advertising community has woken up to the importance of the millennial Latina woman,\" Blacker said. \"It's a really unique situation in a good way.

I\u2019m not worried.\n\nFlock is my default browser. I do everything with it now\u2026 track new contacts photos at Flickr, post photos to Flickr, read RSS articles, post to my blog, and do all my bookmarks with del.icio.us.\n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone, especially if you\u2019re not into blogging, and picture/bookmarks sharing but as for me, Flock is perfect.\n\nRight on! The graphics in flock are gorgeous.\n\nBit harsh to say that Flock \u201clacks substance\u201d, I\u2019ve had it as my default browser for ages now and I find the built in tools highly useful - far better than any implementation made by Firefox extensions.\n\nThe del.icio.us bookmark integration is a killer feature for me. I could care less about sharing my bookmarks with the world, but the integrated bookmark management tools are spectacular. I\u2019m using bookmarks to keep track of sites I want to revisit for the first time in about ten years.\n\nI think you\u2019re being too harsh with Flock. I\u2019ve been using this social browser since it first came out as a Developer\u2019s Preview and have seen it evolve to become the best browser for blogging.\n\n1. Search information on the Internet with the smart search engine features. 2. Photo management totally integrated with Photobucket and Flickr. No other browser comes close to what Flock is actually doing to aid the blogger manage and share photos. 3. Storing information using \u201cWeb Snippets\u201d just by \u201cdragging and dropping\u201d it to the blog editor. 4. Blogging directly to a blog editor embedded inside Blog.\n\nTomorrow Flock will fix the memory leak problem which has not been addressed by Mozilla Firefox.\n\nBart Decrem is still the Chairman of Flock and and will oversee its operations. Steve Jobs left Pixar, but that didn\u2019t collapse that movie corporation. In fact, it later made a fabulous deal merging with Disney Studios.\n\nNo, Flock is not in for trouble. In fact it has just started to get better. Just wait and see.\n\nYeah, this is one of those hasty posts that I just flung out there - may update it later. I do think Flock has some merit, and I think it\u2019s easy to overreact to these announcements - many of the startups that seemed to be struggling have bounced back. My concern with Flock is that people outside the Valley just don\u2019t see the benefit - I\u2019m also not a big fan of hyped-up launches, and maybe that makes me biased against them. What\u2019s more, getting most people to download software (particularly the Photobucket/MySpace gen) seems like a challenge. But I certainly think they\u2019re right to broaden their appeal beyond flickr and del.icio.us users, and I hope the PB integration works out.\n\nOh, and the graphics on Flock are indeed sweet.\n\nHey, this is Geoffrey, the other founder of Flock chiming in. First of all, I want to say thanks to the Flock fans on this thread. Also, the board asked Bart to transition to the role of Chairman so that we could grow the company to its next phase with a CEO more experienced in doing so. The truth is that Flock has raised more than the amount quoted in the original article. In fact, we have sufficient money in the bank to run the company for at least two years and DO have a search deal in place. So, if you are a fan of Flock\u2019s, stay tuned, there some exciting times ahead!\n\nmyspace/photobucket users \u2026are not geeks\n\npaying 10,000 dollars/month for an ad on techcrunch is an utter waste.\n\nit doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out why this startup wont go anywhere\n\nandy, I\u2019ve heard from people of all walks of life that are using Flock and enjoying it. We have users and community members of many ages, countries and levels of geek status. We even welcome the misinformed\n\nWill Pate Community Ambassador, Flock\n\nI converted to Flock from Firefox the day it launched and I love it! Not being a tech geek it\u2019s really opened my world to blogging, photo sharing and bookmarking. In saying that though, I use those probably 1-2% of the time, it\u2019s mainly just a browser for me.\n\nThe average person won\u2019t download a Firefox plugin, I never did. With Flock it\u2019s built in and it makes you say \u201cOooh what\u2019s this? how can I use it?\u201d.\n\nI must say my favourite feature is the \u201ccode snippet\u201d.\n\nIn my day job I consult to top & second tier enterprises regarding their Web solutions. I\u2019m not a geek though, I\u2019m a buinessman. I realise that as businesses grow, you need an experienced CEO to take the wheel. I think it\u2019s a positive. It\u2019s showing their moving forward and they\u2019re building the strong foundation it\u2019ll take to compete with the bigger browsers.\n\nThe bottom line problem is that Flock may be pretty but it doesn\u2019t offer anything more than Firefox and in fact quite a bit less in terms of a large scale committed development community. It\u2019s going nowhere fast, and is destined to be a competitor of Opera and Safari in the low volume browser market. Is that a good basis for a business? Time will tell\u2026\n\nI\u2019d like to echo the comments made by many people here.\n\nBefore Flock, which is my default browser at home, I had little interest in social bookmarking and photo sharing but it has quite simply revolutionised my experience of both such tools.\n\nI find the delicious intergration with real time search functions simply breath taking, I now store thousands of bookmarks and re call them on a daily basis. The same is true of my flickr account.\n\nThe real time yahoo search is also very cool, and while I would prefer it to be Google I appreciate that there must be financial implications there.\n\nI think Flock will have to try and do things to attract more users but at its heart is a good product and given the right time and management it should win more users over.\n\nThis is spurious rumour on my part but does anyone think a Yahoo! aquisition could be on the cards? A Yahoo! browser fully customised to work with Yahoo! tools would be a way to garner mainstream support.\n\nI\u2019d also like to point out the contrary to what has been suggested in the comments above, in an interview with TalkCruch back in June a discussion arose suggesting that Flock was not going to get attention from the geek crowd because it was built FOR the MySpace generation.\n\nI can\u2019t disagree more, the integrated news reader is worth its weight in gold, and, Flock handles OPML like a champ. click an opml link adds feeds.\n\nHi Pete - i have to say that i\u2019m situated well outside the \u2018valley\u2019 in rainy London, and I love Flock! It\u2019s one of the true pieces of web innovation around today. I\u2019m looking forward to when they finally release version 1.0 (and i\u2019m prepared to wait for it!)\n\nHi Geoffrey - congrats on such as fabulous web browser. Flock really is contributing to the evolution of the web. I\u2019d just started using FeedDemon to read my hundreds of feeds, but the feed reader in the most recent version of Flock kills it. However, one of my biggest gripes is that my lovely FireFox plugins no longer work in Flock. So i still have to use FireFox.\n\nI haven\u2019t read everything here just yet, but Flock is the browser I use pretty exclusively now. I give credit to Mozilla for creating firefox as the foundation, so its got a strong base. I think its a niche browser, because what I use it for mostly is for photobucket uploads and posts. If someone does a lot of blogging with pictures, and hasn\u2019t at least tried flock, I think they should. Its not earth shaking.. but some features that are very practical. I hope it sticks around..\n\nOh and I want to add also \u2014 I\u2019m A LITTLE outside the valley too On the Mid-Atlantic coast so, so much for that theory.\n\nFlock is a great browser, but is is a great business? It seems unlikely at this point.\n\nHuh. I use Firefox and Flock : which seems to have dibs on upgrades by default, shutting out FF. That\u2019s not nearly the pain that Flock has never remembered my bookmarks ! I can\u2019t just open the browser and click, with the computyer remembering login, etc. ( I\u2019m working at home, no kids). I\u2019m no geek. Wordpress - which Flock introduced me to - has been great. Flock - kinda useless.\n\nFYI, I have just completed an interview with Geoffrey where he talks about the CEO leaving, where Flock was, is and going and a lot more. http://www.centernetworks.com/interview-with-flock\n\nYou can also download the podcast\n\n[\u2026] Like Flock, the company began at the top of the hype curve, and seemed to tumble from that lofty position over the first few months. But now it seems they\u2019re making some real headway, with eBay, Cafepress, and Amazon agreeing to have their listings included: this always seemed like a more solid business plan that aggregating blog entries, and perhaps the \u201clisting\u201d tag served more as a way to get bloggers talking than as a core strategy. Another major problem in the early days was that Edgeio had thought deeply about the experience for the bloggers publishing to the site, and about all the content they could aggregate from other sites, but not so much about making a great experience: in other words, it\u2019s useless having more listings than everyone else if no one actually goes there to search for stuff. According to VentureBeat, they\u2019re now working on that element.

They also \"lacked appropriate linens and blankets,\" the suit says.\n\nHe contacted Guy, who suggested that he have his 14-year-old son switch rooms and sleep in one of the kiddie beds.\n\n\"He's six feet tall! He's taller than I am,\" Cohen said.\n\nHe said the broker went out on her dime and bought two big beds with mattress, box spring and frames \"to make things right\" \u2014 but the problems continued.\n\nIn two of the bedrooms, the air conditioning wouldn't work.

And they weren't able to fix the problem, leaving the average temperature in the rooms at 75 degrees. \"As a result, these bedrooms were completely tenantable,\" the suit says.\n\nGuy then had window units put in to the two bedrooms, but they didn't make much of a difference with the temperature, the suit says. \"Moreover, in one of the rooms, the blinds can no longer be drawn shut. As a result, any occupants of this room have to contend with the morning sun at 6 a.m.,\" the filing says.\n\nThey've also had to endure \"malfunctioning toilets, broken security gates, broken garage door systems, and an inoperable sauna.

So on Dec. 15, 1950, the U.S. returned 206 items to him: 115 paintings, 19 drawings and 72 \u201cvarious other objects.\u201d\n\nAt least three of the artworks documented by the Americans have now re-surfaced, found hidden in the Munich apartment of Gurlitt\u2019s son, 80-year-old Cornelius Gurlitt, during a tax evasion probe that German prosecutors announced earlier this week.\n\nJournalists awaiting the press conference in Augsburg, southern Germany\n\n\u201cZwei Reiter am Strande\u201d (\u201cTwo riders on the beach\u201d) by Max Liebermann\n\nA reproduction of a painting by Antonio Canaletto\n\nA painting that may be attributed to French painter Henri Matisse\n\nA reproduction of a painting by Belarusian-born French artist Marc Chagall\n\nA reproduction of a painting by Franz Marc\n\nA painting from Otto Dix\n\nA reproduction of an unknown self-portrait by Otto Dix\n\nA piece by Antonio Canaletto during the news conference in Augsburg, southern Germany\n\nFour well-known graffiti artists have been painting a 25-foot high...\n\nFrom a girl snapping one of herself sunbathing with her...\n\nAfter \u201cProject Runway\u2019s\u201d phenomenal success, style icon Tim Gunn realized...\n\nEvery year the barrier islands near the Arctic city of...\n\nA spa in Jakarta is offering customers a new type...\n\nRussia and the Ukraine met to plan to the world\u2019s...\n\nModels gear up for the first ever plus-size fashion week...\n\nVanessa Sky Ellis is the ultimate celebrity stalker, having stockpiled...\n\nRay Villafane and his team of professional sculptors from Bellaire,...\n\nThe three paintings that the Americans returned to Cornelius\u2019 father in 1950 and which have showed up in the Munich trove are Max Liebermann\u2019s \u201cTwo Riders on the Beach;\u201d Otto Dix\u2019s self-portrait and an allegorical painting by Marc Chagall.\n\nAlso found in the son\u2019s apartment were paintings, drawings, engravings, woodcuts and prints by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Oskar Kokoschka, and leading German artists Dix, Liebermann and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.\n\nProsecutors gave few further details about the overall collection. Still, they said they found evidence that at least one item in the Munich apartment \u2014 a Henri Matisse painting of a sitting woman \u2014 was stolen by the Nazis from a French bank in 1942.\n\nChristoph Zuschlag, an art historian at the University of Koblenz, said the American documents indicated U.S. investigators suspected right after the war that Gurlitt may have been in possession of looted art.\n\nHe said if German authorities published a full list of the find at the apartment, then experts could determine more quickly whether Gurlitt was the rightful owner.\n\n\u201cAs a historian, I have to say pictures and information about all the art has to be published online immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cA whole team of experts should work on this discovery and try to answer all the remaining open questions.\u201d\n\nGerman prosecutors who are pursuing the tax case against Cornelius Gurlitt \u2014 whose whereabouts are currently unknown \u2014 said this week they had \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d the artworks found in his apartment included both \u201cdegenerate art\u201d seized from German museums and other works that may have been taken from individuals.\n\nMuseums, galleries and the heirs to those individuals, likely Jewish collectors forced to give up or sell their art at rock-bottom prices, could now have claims.\n\nThe Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which administers restitution claims from victims of Nazi crimes, said the quickest and most efficient way to clear up any doubts would be for prosecutors to release a complete list.\n\nSpokeswoman Hillary Kessler-Godin said the Claims Conference already has an online database of 20,000 looted objects based on the Nazis\u2019 own records that is searchable by owner, artist and other keywords. She said that could be easily used to determine if there are any claims on the Gurlitt collection.\n\n\u201cOur experts believe that a number of the works found in Munich could be in this database,\u201d Kessler-Godin said in an email. \u201cKeeping the list a secret hinders the process of expeditious restitution.\u201d\n\nProminent lawyer and art patron Peter Raue, who works closely with museums in Berlin, said Germany must do its part for transparency, as many families of Jews stripped of their assets under the Nazis believe their works may be among those found.\n\n\u201cIt would be more sensible to post the paintings on the internet; why not with the (London-based) Lost Art Register?\u201d he told the daily Tagesspiegel, according to News.com.au.\n\n\u201cOnly then can there be a chance, for example, for the owners of the breathtakingly beautiful suspected Matisse painting presented on Tuesday to come forward. Maybe the Winterstein family from Ohio will say, \u2018That picture was hanging in our home in Berlin on Klopstockstrasse.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen U.S. investigators questioned Hildebrand Gurlitt in 1945 about the origin of his collection, he told them that he had taken the art with him to Aschbach when he and his family fled Dresden after the city was devastated by Allied bombing in February 1945.\n\n\u201cAll pictures I brought with me \u2026 are the personal property of my family or myself,\u201d Gurlitt told the American interrogators, according to the U.S. documents, first reported by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper of Munich.\n\nBut he said it would be hard for him to prove his ownership of the collection, because all his records and correspondence were \u201cdestroyed in Dresden.\u201d\n\nOne U.S. investigator at the time noted inconsistencies in Gurlitt\u2019s claims to various paintings, while another said he \u201cgave an impression of extreme nervousness and of offering only a minimum of information.\u201d\n\nMarc Masurovsky, an expert on Nazi-era art transactions and co-founder of the Holocaust Art Restitution Project in Washington, said it is likely that Cold War-era investigators questioning a West German who had re-established himself in society probably just took the easy route.\n\n\u201cThe political atmosphere was: We\u2019re just going to go back to work again and not ask lots of uncomfortable questions,\u201d he told the AP.\n\nMasurovsky, who independently also found the National Archives documents and posted them on the Internet, said they raise more questions than they answer.\n\n\u201cThe returned objects are 10 percent of the load\u201d found in Munich, he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhere did the other 90 percent come from? Did Gurlitt have several stashes of art? How many works did he already sell off?\u201d\n\nDespite international pressure, German prosecutors have refused to publish a full inventory of the works, citing a need for more time to fully catalogue them and for discretion in their probe.\n\nThey have launched an investigation on charges of tax evasion and misappropriation of assets against Gurlitt, in whose garbage-strewn Munich apartment the huge trove, including paintings by Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri Matisse was found in February 2012.\n\nThe federal cultural ministry said it was in talks with the Bavarian state government about speeding up the research and publishing the names of paintings \u201cas soon as the provenance of a work is unclear,\u201d a spokesman told German news agency DPA.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert also called for openness, while stressing that the prosecutors were responsible for the probe.\n\nMeanwhile, based on slides of a few of the modernist masterpieces in the collection shown at a news conference on Tuesday, several museums said they were researching whether works had been among their holdings.\n\nUlrike Lorenz, the director of the Kunsthalle Mannheim in southwestern Germany, told public radio that it may have held the portrait Melancholy Girl by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, which was seized by the Nazis in 1937 and considered missing ever since.\n\nThe Von der Heydt Museum in the western city of Wuppertal and the Folkwang Museum in Essen also said they had grounds to believe some of their previous \u201cdegenerate art\u201d holdings were part of the Munich stash.", "summary": "BERLIN \u2014 U.S. military documents are deepening the mystery surrounding the more than 1,400 artworks found in a Munich apartment as museums and heirs push to gain a piece of\u2026", "density": 29.064516129, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 53.5161290323, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/woman-paralyzed-while-helping-stranger-determined-to-walk-aisle-at-wedding/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2012092619id_/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/woman-paralyzed-while-helping-stranger-determined-to-walk-aisle-at-wedding/", "title": "Woman Paralyzed While Helping Stranger Determined to Walk Aisle at Wedding", "date": "2012092619", "text": "A 22-year-old Pennsylvania nursing student who was paralyzed after being struck by a truck last winter is now determined to walk down the aisle at her upcoming wedding.\n\nAlissa Boyle, a nursing student at Waynesburg University, was weeks away from graduating when on Feb. 20 she headed to Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, W.

I've been asking people this question lately. I tell them that I don't mean specific items like cognac, sunglasses or one of my books (which are all excellent gifts). I'm looking instead for the basic characteristics of any good gift. One of the best answers I've gotten so far is this: \"A good gift is something that someone really wants but feels guilty buying for themselves.\" This perspective is interesting because it suggests that the ideal gift is not something that the recipient can't afford or didn't know she wanted. It all comes down to alleviating guilt.\n\nBehavioral economics offers some clues to this guilt-centric approach. Consider the following scenario, based on research by Dick Thaler: You are walking by a storefront and you notice a beautiful coat that is just the right cut and color. Up close it is even more beautiful. Then you discover that it is about twice as expensive as you had originally guessed. After 30 seconds of painful deliberation, you decide that you can't possibly justify paying so much for a coat.\n\n\u201cThe ideal gift is not something that the recipient can't afford or didn't know she wanted.\u201d\n\nWhen you get home, however, you find out that your significant other has bought you that same exact coat\u2026using money from your joint checking account. Would you say, \"Honey, this is very nice of you, but I have already weighed the costs and benefits and decided that this coat is not worth the money, so please take it back immediately\"? Or would you say, \"Thank you so much, I love it!\" I suspect that the answer is the latter. Your significant other got you what you wanted without making you contemplate the guilt associated with the purchase.\n\nAnother paper, by Drazen Prelec and George Loewenstein, lays out a different scenario: Imagine that you have just finished a fantastic meal and have the option to pay with cash or with a credit card. Which one will \"hurt\" you more? Most people say that paying with cash is more miserable\u2014but why? As Messrs. Prelec and Loewenstein showed, when we couple payment with consumption, the result is reduced happiness. When we pay with a credit card, delaying the agony of the payment allows us to experience a higher level of enjoyment.\n\nLet's take this example one step further. Imagine that I own a restaurant and calculate that, on average, people eat 50 bites and pay $50. One day you come to my restaurant and I tell you that because I like you so much, I will charge you half price\u2014only 50\u00a2 per bite. In addition, I will charge you only for the bites you eat. What I will do is serve your food, stand next to you with my notebook and mark each bite you take.\n\nMost people would agree that this is a fantastically cheap meal relative to the regular price, but I also suspect that most of us wouldn't consider it much fun. Every time you took a bite, you would think, \"Is this worth it?\" and, in the process, not enjoy the meal at all. Woody Allen might have captured the gist of the \"pain of paying\" best in \"Manhattan\" when he turns to his date during a taxi ride and says, \"You look so beautiful, I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.\"\n\nWhat these principles tell us is that the best gifts circumvent guilt in two key ways. They eliminate the guilt that accompanies extravagant purchases, and they reduce the guilt that comes from coupling payment with consumption.

Both of the networks have cut all ties, taking the number of TV companies ditching Trump to four following NBC Universal and Univision.\n\n\u201cMr Trump hasn\u2019t demonstrated understanding or respect towards Mexican migrants and has offended the entire Mexican population,\u201d a Televisa spokesman said. \u201cTelevisa isn\u2019t indifferent to these declarations and energetically condemns all forms of discrimination, racism and xenophobia.\u201d\n\nRelated: Univision severs ties with Donald Trump and Miss Universe pageant\n\nTelevisa\u2019s decision not to broadcast Miss Universe means there will be no Mexican contestant in this year\u2019s competition. Televisa and former Miss Universe Lupita Jones organize a pageant to select a Mexican candidate for the contest.\n\nArturo El\u00edas Ayub, the chairman of Ora, said it was \u201cincredible that someone can think like this in the 21st century and have this racist position\u201d.\n\nAyub, who is also Slim\u2019s son-in-law, said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201ctotally out of line [and] working with someone so close-minded was not going to work\u201d. He said Ora last week scrapped a reality series it was working on with Trump\u2019s companies last week.\n\nTrump sparked a minor diplomatic incident when he launched his presidential bid earlier this month with an attack on Mexico for \u201csending people [to the US] that have lots of problems, and they are bringing those problems to us. They are bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and their rapists.\u201d He also called on Mexico to fund the building of a \u201cgreat wall\u201d along the southern border to prevent the supposed influx of Mexican criminals to the US.\n\nOn Monday he defended his stance. \u201cPublic reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants. This must be stopped and it must be stopped now,\u201d Trump said after being dropped by NBC.\n\nIn Mexico protests have ranged from the artisan who started selling Trump pi\u00f1atas, to the fury expressed by newscasters, pop stars, politicians, and columnists.\n\nImmediately after Trump made his remarks, Televisa\u2019s nighttime news anchor, Joaquin Lopez Doriga called the magnate \u201can imbecile.\u201d This, he added, \u201cis not an insult, it is a description.\u201d Fher Olvera, lead singer of the Mexican group Mana, began his response in charitable mood. \u201cWe feel pity for this incompetent man,\u201d he said during a concert in Los Angeles before adding, \u201cI have never heard a speech as violent or as filled with hatred \u2013 not since Hitler.\u201d\n\nFormer actress Carmen Salinas, who was elected to be a federal deputy earlier this month, uploaded a video on Youtube in which she told Trump he has \u201cthe face of a dried up louse.\u201d Former presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, meanwhile, said Trump\u2019s comments should not surprise Mexicans. \u201cEven if the donkey is carrying gold and puts on airs and graces with ridiculous blond hair, it is still a donkey,\u201d he wrote in his column in the newspaper Milenio.\n\nWith the controversy lasting weeks, some commentators have turned their criticism inwards, taking aim at the Mexican government\u2019s direct response to Trump\u2019s comments many see as giving them an importance they should not have. Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said they showed \u201ca deep ignorance of the reality of Mexicans, and the contribution of migrants.\u201d\n\nJavier Garza, a former newspaper editor, said this official willingness to engage with Trump came from the government\u2019s failure to develop an active strategy to address migration issues involving Mexicans within the United States.Writing in a chat of prominent commentators curated by the news website Animal Politico, Garza said the government should be preparing a such a strategy to respond to possible \u201cMexico-bashing\u201d in the primaries. \u201cBut in an intelligent way,\u201d he added, \u201cnot getting embroiled in individual debates with buffoons who only want to provoke.\u201d", "summary": "Carols Slim, Mexico\u2019s richest man, criticises Trump\u2019s disparaging comments, as Televisa\u2019s refusal to air the Miss Universe pageant means there will be no Mexican contestant", "density": 3.2258064516, "coverage": 0.8387096774, "compression": 27.2258064516, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/witness-san-francisco-police-shooting-homeless-man-luis-gongora", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2016041219id_/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/witness-san-francisco-police-shooting-homeless-man-luis-gongora", "title": "Sixth witness disputes police account of homeless man's killing in San Francisco", "date": "2016041219", "text": "A key witness to the police shooting of a homeless man in San Francisco on Thursday has come forward to say that the man was \u201crelaxed\u201d, \u201cisolated\u201d, and not \u201cposing a threat to anyone\u201d before two police officers opened fire.\n\nChristine Pepin, a 45-year-old resident of Sunnyvale, is the latest witness to challenge the police narrative that Luis Gongora was armed and dangerous.\n\nPepin can be seen in a surveillance video that captures a partial view of the shooting. The footage, obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle, shows a woman walking on the sidewalk across the street from where two police officers approached and shot Gongora. As the gunfire erupted, the woman ducked and ran down the sidewalk, away from the shooting.\n\n\u201cHe was sitting on the ground, his back against the wall,\u201d Pepin said about Gongora. \u201cHe seemed to be holding something in his left hand, but I didn\u2019t see a knife. He didn\u2019t seem aggressive. He seemed kind of lost and confused.\n\n\u201cHis head was against the building, sitting down, and his knees were bent, like in a relaxed manner,\u201d she added.\n\nPepin said that the officers were approximately seven to 10 meters from Gongora, and that no one else was close to him: \u201cHe was pretty much isolated. He was alone.\u201d\n\nShe said she then saw an officer aim a \u201cbig black and orange\u201d gun at Gongora, and heard the officer tell Gongora to stay on the ground.\n\n\u201cI was shocked by this because it seemed to me that the person was harmless,\u201d Pepin said. \u201cThe officers started shooting, and I thought, \u2018This must not be real ammunition,\u2019 I thought, \u2018because why would they do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nPepin started to run away, and her view was blocked by a parked car, so she did not see what happened next.\n\nLike S Smith Patrick, another witness who has challenged the police narrative of the shooting, Pepin said that she had assumed Gongora had threatened the police officers in a separate incident. After watching the surveillance video, however, she said she realized that she had witnessed the beginning of the encounter.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem that he was posing a threat to anyone. He looked lost. He didn\u2019t look aggressive,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how a man, even with a knife in his hands \u2013 which I didn\u2019t see \u2013 how he could pose a threat to three officers with fully loaded weapons. That is really what shocked me.\u201d\n\nPepin is the sixth witness to tell the Guardian that Gongora was not posing a threat.\n\nThe parade of eyewitness accounts \u2013 and the release of the surveillance video \u2013 appears to have prompted an unusually aggressive public relations effort by the embattled police department.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, police commander Greg McEachern released information about four witness statements, all of which he said supported the idea that \u201cas the officers contacted the individual, he moved forward to them with a knife in hand\u201d.\n\nBut McEachern acknowledged that he was releasing just a selection of more than 10 witness statements the department has gathered, and that the department had not completed its interviews with the officers involved.\n\nAccording to the commander, one witness saw Gongora \u201clunge at the officers\u201d. A second said Gongora had been \u201cflailing his hands with the knife as he ran toward the officers\u201d. A third said \u201cthe knife was raised up as he ran toward the officers\u201d.\n\nThe fourth witness McEachern cited was John Visor, a friend of Gongora\u2019s who lived in the same homeless encampment in the Mission District and was the first to challenge the police narrative.\n\nThe commander said Visor told police that he \u201csaw the suspect\u2019s knife appear on the sidewalk\u201d. But McEachern noted that Visor did not give police the same details he later gave reporters.\n\nOn Thursday, Visor told reporters: \u201cHe didn\u2019t charge at the officers. He was going in circles because he didn\u2019t understand what they said. He had a knife on him but he didn\u2019t have it out. He had it on his hip, and when he hit the ground, that\u2019s when it fell out.\u201d\n\nStephanie Grant, another witness and Visor\u2019s partner, agreed with his account, adding: \u201cThey didn\u2019t wait for anything. It all happened so fast.\u201d\n\nRosalyn Barnett, another resident of the homeless encampment, told the Guardian that she had been standing with Visor and Grant when the shooting took place but that the police had not taken a statement from her.\n\nBarnett agreed that Gongora was sitting on the ground when police first approached, and said that the knife was sitting on the ground beside him.\n\n\u201cHe was already sitting on the ground. He wasn\u2019t touching the knife,\u201d she said. \u201cThey start launching the beanbags. He\u2019s sitting down the whole time. They didn\u2019t tell him to put his hands on his head, behind his back, none of that.\u201d\n\nBarnett said that after Gongora was hit with beanbags, he stood up and tried to run away.\n\n\u201cHe was running away. He wasn\u2019t running toward them,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t that kind of person.\u201d\n\nTwo people who live in apartments across the street from the site of the shooting have also challenged the police account.\n\nPatrick, who watched the entire incident from her apartment window, told the Guardian: \u201cHe didn\u2019t get up until they were shooting. I would by no stretch of the imagination say that he was charging them. His body was recoiling from bullets.\u201d\n\nAnother neighbor, who asked to remain anonymous, watched the incident from his kitchen window, and told the Guardian: \u201cHe was not really threatening. He wasn\u2019t running at them with a knife or anything like that. They just jumped right out and 20 seconds later he was dead.\u201d\n\nIf you have information about this shooting, please contact julia.wong@theguardian.com", "summary": "Woman says Luis Gongora appeared \u2018relaxed\u2019 and was \u2018not posing a threat to anyone\u2019 before officers shot and killed him", "density": 1.5, "coverage": 0.7727272727000001, "compression": 53.8181818182, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2016/05/26/taking-ciclismo-classico-bike-travel-film-festival-for-spin/ttz8gPhnn3hrQgkWouPzRO/story.html", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160528141049id_/http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2016/05/26/taking-ciclismo-classico-bike-travel-film-festival-for-spin/ttz8gPhnn3hrQgkWouPzRO/story.html", "title": "Taking the Ciclismo Classico Bike Travel Film Festival for a spin", "date": "20160528141049", "text": "Who knew bike travel yielded so many entertaining short films?

Yet this small Afghan village was once famous for the catastrophe that took place there during the First Anglo-Afghan War in January 1842, arguably the greatest humiliation ever suffered by a Western army in the East.\n\nThe course of that distant Victorian war followed a trajectory that is beginning to seem distinctly familiar. In 1839, the British invaded Afghanistan on the basis of dubious intelligence about a nonexistent threat: information about a single Russian envoy to Kabul, the Afghan capital, was manipulated by a group of ambitious hawks to create a scare about a phantom Russian invasion, thus bringing about an unnecessary, expensive and wholly avoidable conflict.\n\nInitially, the British conquest proved remarkably easy and bloodless; Kabul was captured within a few months and a pliable monarch, Shah Shuja, placed on the throne. Then an insurgency began which unraveled that first heady success, first among the Pashtuns of Kandahar and Helmand, then slowly moving northward until it reached the capital.\n\nWhat happened next is a warning of how bad things could yet become: a full-scale rebellion against the British broke out in Kabul, and the two most senior British envoys were murdered, making the British occupation impossible to sustain. On the disastrous retreat that followed, as many as 18,000 East India Company troops and maybe half again as many Indian camp followers (estimates vary), were slaughtered by Afghan marksmen waiting in ambush amid the snow drifts and high passes, shot down as they trudged through the icy depths of the Afghan winter.\n\nThe last 50 or so survivors made their final stand at Gandamak. As late as the 1970s, fragments of Victorian weaponry could be found lying in the screes above the village; even today, the hill is covered with bleached British bones. Only one man, Thomas Souter, lived to tell the tale. It is a measure of the increasingly pertinent parallels between the events of 1842 and today\u2019s that one of the main NATO bases in Afghanistan is named Camp Souter.\n\nFor the Victorian British, Gandamak became a symbol of the country\u2019s greatest ever imperial defeat, as well as a symbol of gallantry: William Barnes Wollen\u2019s celebrated painting of the Last Stand of the 44th Foot \u0097 a group of ragged but determined British soldiers standing in a circle behind their bayonets as the Pashtun tribesmen close in \u0097 was one of the era\u2019s most famous images.\n\nFor the Afghans themselves, Gandamak became a symbol of freedom, and their determination to refuse to be controlled by any foreign power. It is again no accident that the diplomatic quarter of Kabul is named after the Afghan resistance leader who oversaw the British defeat at Gandamak, Wazir Akbar Khan.\n\nA week or so ago, while doing research for a book on the disaster of 1842, I only narrowly avoided the fate of my Victorian compatriots.\n\nGandamak backs onto the mountain range that leads to Tora Bora and the Pakistan border, an area that has always been a Taliban center. I was trying to follow the route of the British retreat, but had been advised not to attempt to visit the Gandamak area without local protection. So I set off in the company of a local tribal leader who is also a sports minister in the Karzai government, Anwar Khan Jigdalek. A mountain of a man, Anwar Khan is a former wrestling champion who made his name as the mujaheddin commander against the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\n\nWe left Kabul \u0097 past the blast walls of the NATO barracks that were built on the very site of the British cantonment of 170 years ago \u0097 and headed into the line of bleak mountain passes that link Kabul with the Khyber Pass. At Sarobi we left the main road, and moved into Taliban territory; five trucks full of Anwar Khan\u2019s old mujaheddin comrades, all brandishing rocket-propelled grenades, appeared to escort us.\n\nAt Jigdalek, on the 12th of January, 1842, 200 frostbitten British soldiers found themselves surrounded by several thousand Pashtun tribesmen. The two highest-ranking British soldiers were taken hostage. It was 50 of those infantrymen who later managed to break out under cover of darkness to make the final passage to Gandamak. Our own welcome to the village was, thankfully, somewhat warmer.\n\nWilliam Dalrymple, the author of the forthcoming \u0093Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India,\u0094 is writing a book on the First Anglo-Afghan War.", "summary": "What NATO faces in Afghanistan now increasingly parallels what the British faced 170 years ago.", "density": 1.4375, "coverage": 0.8125, "compression": 52.9375, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/african-pensions-funds-invest-in-infrastructure-projects-1430985433", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160809192559id_/http://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/african-pensions-funds-invest-in-infrastructure-projects-1430985433", "title": "African Pensions Funds Invest in Infrastructure Projects", "date": "20160809192559", "text": "LAGOS, Nigeria\u2014The fiber-optic cable that entrepreneur Funke Opeke laid along the Atlantic seabed from Europe has helped bring the Internet to nearly half of Nigeria\u2019s 170 million people.\n\nIt is also generating returns for the many thousands of African retirees whose money is invested in her company, MainOne.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting their money to work,\u201d Ms. Opeke said over the hum of server towers and air conditioners at the data center she built here to keep banks and big companies in Africa\u2019s top economy online.\n\nAfrican pension funds are starting to invest in infrastructure projects on their underdeveloped continent. The African Development Bank hopes the deepening pool of homegrown savings can fill the $45 billion hole it sees in annual infrastructure financing needed in Africa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented chance to make the investments in infrastructure and other sectors that the continent so desperately needs,\u201d said David Ashiagbor, who runs a division of the bank devoted to developing financial markets in Africa.\n\nUntil recently, most pension funds in Africa were hesitant to invest in infrastructure such as roads, railroads and ports. Tying up cash in decadelong projects seemed unnecessarily risky while strong economic growth was driving up local stock markets. Africa\u2019s economy has recently grown by about 5% annually thanks to strong oil and mineral output as well as the rise of a nascent consumer class.\n\nThe continent\u2019s sovereign bonds were also generating strong returns because they are issued at a premium that reflects their riskiness relative to developed-market issuers like the U.S.\n\nThat strategy is still working\u2014almost too well. African pension funds that focus on stocks and bonds in their home markets have swelled. Namibia\u2019s government pension fund manages assets worth 80% of the southern African country\u2019s gross domestic product. Botswana\u2019s local stock-and-bond holdings equal 40% of the diamond-rich nation\u2019s GDP.\n\nRegulators and fund managers are starting to recognize that keeping all their assets at home can be risky, too. As a result, some African pension funds are spreading out, seeking similarly strong returns in the stocks and infrastructure projects of other countries on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe have to diversify,\u201d said Sbu Luthuli, who oversees more than $10 billion in pension assets for South Africa\u2019s state-backed power company.\n\nLate last year Mr. Luthuli\u2019s Eskom Pension and Provident Fund invested $30 million in infrastructure projects through Dubai-based Abraaj Group. In 2011, Eskom invested $5 million in a company that builds mobile-phone towers through London\u2019s Helios Investment Partners LLP.\n\nMr. Luthuli wants to put a total of more than $100 million into infrastructure projects outside South Africa. Other government-backed funds are mulling similar moves, opening nearly $30 billion in pension money to infrastructure projects, the African Development Bank estimates\u2014as much as private-equity firms have invested in African infrastructure to date.\n\nThat is less than a tenth of pension holdings that have surpassed $370 billion as a middle class blooms across the continent. Some financiers say pension funds are too risk-averse to tackle the projects that could really change Africa\u2019s developmental trajectory.\n\nAndrew Alli, chief executive of Lagos-based Africa Finance Corp., a multilateral lender with $2.8 billion invested in more than 20 countries, said pension funds are better suited to buy into proven projects that are rare on the continent today. \u201cThe assets at the right stage of maturity don\u2019t really exist,\u201d he said.\n\nBut pension-fund managers say private-equity managers are beating down their doors to grab a piece of the action. \u201cPrivate-equity funds are making the loudest noise,\u201d said Dave Uduanu, managing director of Nigeria\u2019s Pensions Alliance Ltd.\n\nOne is Harith General Partners Ltd., a Johannesburg-based infrastructure fund invested in more than 70 African projects, including the MainOne fiber optic cable project in Nigeria.\n\nA half dozen African pension funds invested in the $630 million fund that Harith tapped to inject $30 million into MainOne in 2009. In addition to Mr. Luthuli\u2019s Eskom fund and Ghana\u2019s public-sector fund, Harith\u2019s backers include South Africa\u2019s Government Employees Pension Fund, a $140 billion operation with 1.2 million members.\n\nHemal Naran, the South African pension fund\u2019s head of investment, said it contributed $250 million to Harith\u2019s first fund because of the quality of the companies it was investing in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a charity\u2014we want to make a return,\u201d Mr. Naran said. \u201cWe see great potential in Africa\u2019s infrastructure bottlenecks.\u201d\n\nThat same potential drew Ms. Opeke home to Nigeria in 2005 after 24 years in the U.S. After helping South African mobile company MTN Group push into Nigeria, now its largest market, Ms. Opeke started a company devoted to one of Nigeria\u2019s many development deficits.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come back just to make money for MTN,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to add some fundamental value.\u201d\n\nMs. Opeke raised $240 million to bring the second undersea Internet cable in Nigeria, which made landfall in 2009. By the following July, it was piping more than 30 gigabytes per second to Nigerian Internet users.

We swarm through the city\u2019s streets and subways, moving together like parts in a machine. We are replaceable, we are erasable, we are disposable. We will all die. Soon no one will know we existed.\n\nThat\u2019s what a little voice kept telling me on a recent New York afternoon. It was issuing from a set of headphones I had been given while standing in a graveyard in Brooklyn, but it might as well have been coming from inside my head. I mean, doesn\u2019t everyone who\u2019s spent time in a crowded urban environment entertain such grim speculations?\n\n\u201cRemote New York\u201d \u2014 a remarkably efficient if seldom surprising exercise in crowd control from the German arts collective Rimini Protokoll \u2014 gives precise and neutral voice to thoughts most veteran city dwellers surely have on a regular basis. Created by Stefan Kaegi, this interactive piece of street theater assembles a throng of paying participants, and then sends them onto a meticulously plotted tour of New York City and their own herd mentality.\n\nFor most of this trip, our guide \u2014 or \u201cshepherd,\u201d or \u201cfriend,\u201d as she likes to call herself \u2014 is Heather. She is a disembodied, computerized, amalgamated voice who speaks to us via headset and a small black box of a receiver we are encouraged to clip securely onto our clothing. There is also a human guide at hand in case we should stray, revolt or \u2014 heaven forfend \u2014 perish en route.\n\nBut that person is, like us, only a minor player. After all, she\u2019s only human. Heather (you may be tempted to call her Big Sister) is the de facto star, the governing intelligence in a production in which if all the city is indeed a stage, then all its men and women are merely extras.\n\nI\u2019ve taken part before in interactive walking-tours-as-theater, including the memorable \u201cAngel Project\u201d (in New York in 2003) and \u201cYou Once Said Yes\u201d (London, 2012). The pleasure of such works usually comes from the ways they reorient your external vision, making you look more closely at \u2014 and see new things in \u2014 a seemingly unexceptional cityscape.\n\nSuch joys are fewer during the two hours of \u201cRemote New York,\u201d which encourages a kind of fatalistic introspection. This despite the fact that you are covering miles, by foot and on subway, and told regularly by Heather to look around you.\n\nShe instructs you, for instance, to observe those acres of tombstones in the Brooklyn cemetery where the trip begins, and then to look to the rows of houses beyond. How tenuous the line is between the living and the dead, says Heather, who sounds rather like a cross between HAL, the evil computer in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d and the seductive title character, an operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 film \u201cHer.\u201d And what are houses but tombs for the living?\n\nThis line of logic extends to the consideration that we may not be quite as alive or as independent as we think we are in this age of dominant technology. Per Heather\u2019s instructions, we move together (several dozen of us) like sheep, or cows, or even zombies. Choose your simile; they\u2019re all on offer, as well as accompanying sound effects.\n\nOn occasion, Heather tries to stir up our Darwinian survival instincts, asking to us assess our fellow herd members (to ourselves) and pick out who we think is weakest, or least attractive. She is more likely to see how willing we are to act as a unit, in following instructions to pretend to tie our shoelaces simultaneously while on the subway or to all walk backward on a street in Greenwich Village.\n\nIt\u2019s good, I think, to be made to realize how \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 we are willing to do things as part of a group that we might never do individually, like walk in a flash-mob demonstration or disco boogie in an open square. And it came as a bit of a jolt, to me at least, to realize how relaxing it is to have an anonymous someone tell you exactly what to do and where to go at all times.\n\nAny parallels to a brave new world in which machines will rule us (or already do) probably don\u2019t need to be made as explicit as they are here. But maybe that\u2019s just the old individual self in me, wanting to think for itself.\n\n\u201cRemote New York\u201d is perhaps best thought of as ego-shrinking therapy. Considered as such, it would be wonderful to see the power players from a restaurant like Michael\u2019s or the Four Seasons snatched from their lunch tables and commanded to take part in this humbling forced march.\n\nConcept and direction by Stefan Kaegi; research and codirection by J\u00f6rg Karrenbauer; sound by Nikolas Neecke; assistant director and sound editor, Ilona Marti; dramaturgy by Juliane M\u00e4nnel; production manager, Caroline Gentz.

And to put it kindly, they are less than glowing.\n\n\"Painful to watch,\" said another.\n\n\"Their window didn't close slowly -- it shut,\" said a third.\n\nKeep in mind, it's only spring. In fact, it's relatively early in spring. But the Phillies needed victories the past two days to improve their record to 4-10. They're batting .210 with a .623 OPS, averaging just 3.6 runs per game. And while all of this ultimately might mean nothing, the entire vibe around the Phils is rather ominous.\n\nLeft-hander Cole Hamels could miss the first month due to shoulder issues. Three lesser rotation candidates also are dealing with shoulder problems. And if that's not enough, the organization is still stinging from an embarrassing episode in which it violated baseball protocol by turning in two draft picks to the NCAA for using agents during negotiations.\n\nMaybe it all will pass. Hamels could return by May and join lefty Cliff Lee and righty A.J. Burnett to form a formidable front three in the rotation. Righty setup man Mike Adams is making good progress in his recovery from shoulder surgery. And the offense just might need more time to find its rhythm.\n\nBut right now, scouts are asking whether the Phillies are even as good as the Marlins.\n\n\"If we were swinging the bat more consistently, I'd be much happier,\" said general manager Ruben Amaro Jr., whose job could be in jeopardy if the Phils perform poorly. \"But the last few days have been encouraging. We've made much better contact.\n\n\"It's a work in progress. We usually start these guys slowly. We've got to start giving them multiple at-bats, as many as they need, 60 to 80 so they're ready for the season.\n\nAmaro specifically cited Ryan Howard, who did not play after July 5 last season due to left-knee inflammation and is batting .200 with a .539 OPS and zero homers in 30 at-bats.\n\n\"Part of it is that these guys are not young,\" Amaro said. \"We don't want to kill 'em. We want to make sure they're healthy come April. It's a balance between getting everyone ready and playing them too much. It's one of the biggest things Ryno is working on.\"\n\nSandberg vs. Rollins actually fits into that narrative -- Sandberg told reporters Thursday that he did not play Rollins three straight games because he wanted to give Freddy Galvis an extended look at short.\n\nBut the manager, entering his first full season, also met with Rollins on Thursday to discuss what the shortstop told the Philadelphia Daily News when asked about the team's offensive struggles this spring.\n\n\"Who cares?\" said Rollins, who went on to explain -- quite accurately -- that spring-training statistics usually mean little once the regular season begins.\n\n\"I wanted him to clarify that because I wanted to make sure he cared,\" Sandberg told reporters in Clearwater, Fla. \"I wanted to make sure he wasn't speaking for the ballclub with, 'Who cares?' \"\n\nThe manager clearly was making a point, even if he wanted to make sure Galvis could handle shortstop if Rollins is injured. But really, the Phillies have no one but themselves to blame for Jimmy being Jimmy. They knew that his approach was occasionally laissez-faire, yet re-signed him to a three-year, $33 million free-agent contract prior to his age 33 season in Dec. 2011.\n\nNow, the Phillies need Rollins to help them snap out of it, if he's even capable of that anymore. Rollins is coming off his worst offensive season. And after Sandberg praised Galvis for his \"energy and positive influence\" earlier in the week, he replied, \"no comment,\" when asked about Rollins in the same light.\n\nOh, Sandberg vs. Rollins is a doozy, all right.

This lens is a huge cluster of galaxies whose collective gravity warps space-time, producing what's called a gravitational lens. As the distant galaxy's light traveled through this lens on its way to Earth, it was magnified.\n\n- Space Telescope Science Institute's Dan Coe\n\n\"This cluster does what no manmade telescope can do,\" Marc Postman of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., said in a statement unveiling the discovery Thursday, Nov. 15. \"Without the magnification, it would require a Herculean effort to observe this galaxy.\" Postman leads the Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH), which performed the study.\n\nThe distant galaxy is just a tiny blob, and is much smaller than our own Milky Way, researchers said. The object is very young, and it also dates from an epoch when the universe itself was still a baby, just 420 million years old, or 3 percent of its present age.

The last object to hold the title of farthest thing ever seen was the galaxy SXDF-NB1006-2, which lies 12.91 billion light-years from Earth. That object was sighted by the Subaru and Keck Telescopes in Hawaii.\n\nThe CLASH survey, which discovered the new galaxy, MACS0647-JD, is working on a cosmic census of 25 large galaxy clusters using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys. Those instruments first spotted MACS0647-JD, and then the Spitzer telescope, which observes in infrared light, confirmed the object was as far away as it appeared.\n\nFollow Clara Moskowitz on Twitter @ClaraMoskowitz or SPACE.com @Spacedotcom.

Some people seem to be wired for success in certain endeavors from a very early age and have a head start over their peers. For example, when I was growing up and when my children were growing up, there were some kids who seemed like \"natural\" athletes. Put them in a pool and they swam. Put them on a bike and they stayed up. Throw a ball and they caught it.\n\nBut quite often, even usually in my experience, when those kids were teenagers, they were not necessarily the best athletes. The reason was simple: They had relied on their \"natural abilities\" while their friends had taken lessons and practiced. For some of those friends, it took a lot of lessons and an enormous amount of practice to compensate for their inherent deficiencies, but with the will and commitment they were able to reach a much higher skill level than anyone would have predicted.\n\nSo it is for Schuringa's qualities.

My wife saw it in the window of a toy store in our neighborhood and thought it would be amusing to give to our 2-year-old daughter, Sami.\n\nThe doll, really more of a hard-plastic action figure, is maybe five inches tall, with a swivel head and rotating arms. She\u2019s wearing a blue pantsuit and a frozen smile.\n\nFor a while, Sami loved the doll; she called it Blue Baby, and when her language got better, Hilly Kinton. Then she lost interest, and the doll sank to the bottom of the toy basket in our living room, buried under Winnie the Pooh, a volleyball and a jack-in-the-box.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Sami woke up early. When I went in to get her, she looked directly at me and said, \u201cWhere Hilly Kinton?\u201d She had no idea what was going on, of course \u2014 she\u2019d probably just been hearing the name a lot lately.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMaybe she is,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI want to find her,\u201d she said.\n\nWe marched to the living room, dug through the toy basket and finally found her, one gray high heel wedged into a xylophone. Sami sat down on the rug and, for a very long time, just stared at her. All morning, she refused to let go. When she got bored with breakfast, she cranked Hilly Kinton\u2019s arms straight up and ran back and forth holding her aloft. \u201cShe\u2019s flying, Dada!\u201d she said. \u201cHilly Kinton flying!\u201d\n\nShe insisted on taking the doll to preschool, which doesn\u2019t usually allow outside toys. The teacher looked at Sami clutching the little blue figure and gave me a sad smile. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said.\n\nI went home. My wife and our younger daughter, who was born in July, had passed out together on the living room couch, catching up after a sleepless night. When I had stumbled home after finally leaving work, shock-drunk at 3 a.m., my wife was still lying awake in the dark, tears running onto her pillow. It had been so close, this new world. A woman in charge, at last. Maybe to comfort myself, I thought of all the women and girls in my life who were not experiencing the heartbreak of this night.\n\nMy grandmother Dina, dead almost 20 years. She was born in 1918 \u2014 old enough to remember the last time Jews did not feel entirely safe in America. She was a Communist, like her husband and most of their friends, many of them targeted by the McCarthy investigations. I\u2019ve been trying to imagine how I would explain to her what happened on Tuesday. And Roy Cohn was his lawyer, Grandma! I picture her coming back, seeing her nemesis resurrected, only this time in the shape of the most powerful man in the world.\n\nMy mother has been gone seven years, and this is the first time I\u2019ve felt relief she\u2019s not here. She was already sick when Barack Obama won in 2008. His election gave her so much hope, for the country and for her own perilous future, that she wrote the president-elect a long and very personal letter. She\u2019d never written to a politician before.\n\nMy daughters are both far too young to understand any of this. The baby knows nothing but the warm safety of her mother\u2019s arms, the comforting press of her breast.\n\nHer smile, which she only recently discovered, is everything that is simple and open and pure, untouched by loss or pain or the complications of grown-up life. On Wednesday afternoon, she flashed it at me while she was on the changing table, and I cried.\n\nI am sure Sami, two years older, senses that something is wrong \u2014 with her parents, with the people she sees on the street \u2014 at least in our little dark-blue corner of the country. A mood she picks up, even if she cannot articulate it. But for her, life remains blessedly free of abuse or insult. She hasn\u2019t been catcalled by a construction worker or groped by a congressman. No insecure man has called her ugly or fat. She will have defeats in her life, and I want her to learn to handle them with grace and equanimity. Still, I\u2019m grateful she missed this one.\n\nWhen I talk to friends with older daughters, hear how they struggled to break the news over breakfast, how they dealt with the sobs, I feel lucky. I was spared, this time, from inflicting heartache. I didn\u2019t have to explain reality to Sami; in fact, she got to explain it to me. For her, Hilly Kinton is not just doing O.K.

Photograph: Graeme Robertson\n\nVivid pools of paint cover the floor, flecks of colour camouflage the white studio walls and a drum kit sits, pristine, in the corner.\n\nThe drums, says Turner-nominated artist Ian Davenport from his Peckham studio, are an essential part of the process of producing his vast canvases covered with dripping paint.\n\n\"It's quite a performative kind of painting. These works have a very digitalised, sort of pulsing rhythm that goes through them yet they are still about colour and line. I'm really interested in that idea of beats and pulses and how you put it together.\"\n\nA contemporary of the group of Goldsmith art-school students who became known as the Young British Artists (YBAs), Davenport was among those who exhibited at Damien Hirst's landmarkFreeze exhibition in 1988.\n\nIn 1991 he became the youngest nominee for the Turner prize and Hirst, who recently wrote the introduction to a book of Davenport's work, still credits him for inspiring his spot paintings. Davenport's first retrospective in Britain, titled Colourfall, opens Wednesday.\n\nRather than painting, Davenport now uses a syringe to create his glossy abstract works, carefully squirting paint into the canvas and letting it drip down in a perfectly straight line, till it merges in a chaos of colour at the bottom \u2013 a process that took him almost a decade to perfect.Davenport said: \"It's about trying to hold onto something that is quite controlled and balanced and then something which is free and uncontrolled. It is that paradox that makes these paintings so interesting in my mind.\n\n\"The movement of the paint is of real interest to me, it's about how you control the fluid but also how the liquid of the paint creates shapes itself independently. It's quite an unusual viewing experience. I'm just really into paint and materials.\"\n\nHe continues: \"I appreciate that it is a simple concept in many ways, but that's where the beauty lies. I never expected that something so simple would open up so much, but just by sampling different colours together in different combinations, allowing them to drip and flow into one another on the canvas, it is almost like being a composer playing around with notes, it's almost inexhaustible what you can do with it.\"\n\nThe distinctive character and scale of Davenport's work caught the attention of Southwark council, who in 2006 commissioned him to create a piece of artwork that would reinvigorate the dank underpass beneath Western railway bridge. His 48m-long creation, named Poured Lines, is one of the largest pieces of public artwork in Europe and has since become a London landmark. He is now in talks to create another mammoth piece of public art for an \"unnamed government building\".\n\nDavenport's influences are as colourful and diverse as the paintings themselves. Included in the upcoming exhibition is a new work, Colourfall: Holbein, which takes unlikely inspiration from Hans Holbein's 15th-century painting The Ambassadors.\n\n\"Holbein's painting is really about red and green and black, and how the colours punctuate the space, so I've broken that down in my painting, using his unique colour palette against a dark green background. And I also think there is something rather beautiful about how the distorted skull in the Holbein is echoed in the paint lines that merge at the bottom of my work.\"\n\nIn another work, Puddle Painting: Blue Study (after Van Gogh), Davenport explores the \"brilliant\" colour palette used in Van Gogh paintings, juxtaposing similar blues and oranges through drips and lines on his canvas.\n\nYet in his determination to ensure his work is full of \"energy and joy\", Davenport drew from popular culture as well as the old Masters, with two of the new works for the Colourfall exhibition, titled Second Series, directly inspired by the colour palette of The Simpsons.\n\nHe said: \"I just got a Simpsons DVD and I was just flicking though and lifting the colours from certain areas. It gives me something to react to, and stops my paintings from being too arbitrary.

With my graduate degree, I could easily be making a third more, maybe even 150% of my federal salary. Of course, I keep the federal job because I enjoy the work and let's be honest, there are some good perks - most notably job security. But I get so sick of the general impression that federal employees are lazy and greedy. Sure, there are lazy, greedy feds, but there are lazy, greedy employees in the private sector as well. And both public and private industry also have a lot of hard working people who just want to do the best job possible.\n\nPosted by: runnergirl03 | February 10, 2010 10:33 AM | Report abuse\n\nThe real problems with the Federal workforce are at the top end, those sitting around for decades getting automatic raises (for no good reason) while each year falling farther behind in productivity. However, age discrimination laws make it very, very tricky to deal with this. Some Agencies are smart about retirement buyouts and the like. This is more rational than punishing everybody.\n\nThe entry-level, mid-career level people are making HUGE sacrifices to stay in the government. Almost all of them are MUCH BETTER EDUCATED than their older counterparts. About the only allure is the job security, because many of them have young families.\n\nI have been away from government for just 2 years, and my salary has increased already by 50 percent without much effort. Private sector companies compete for my skills. The government tells me to take it or leave it.\n\nDon't tell me all Feds are overpaid.\n\nPosted by: Wallenstein | February 10, 2010 10:35 AM | Report abuse\n\nThe 95% of federal employees who are lazy make the rest look bad.\n\nThe federal government has been closed for three days.

Instead of being able to hire the best and the brightest, we're incumbered with those who are able to get government jobs and stay there because of preferences and unions.\n\nPosted by: CurrentFED | February 10, 2010 5:21 PM | Report abuse\n\nI also wish this were true! I accepted my current government job because I believe in public service, I like the work, and I appreciate the job security. The only downside to going public was the wage cut -- my private sector salary was 2.75 times what I'm currently drawing! Don't get me wrong: I willingly made the trade-off and haven't looked back. . . but it's still makes me wonder where the Naked Senator gets his intel.\n\nPosted by: Aelcee | February 10, 2010 5:52 PM | Report abuse\n\nNo problem Senator Brown. I know that you work in a different branch of government, but there is nothing stopping you from showing a little leadership on this issue. Why don't you freeze your salary and the salaries of your staff. If it is inconvenient to do that withing the Senate payroll system, just make a donation to the IRS. To take a really positive step, cut the salaries of your staff in half, since that will put them on par with the private sector.\n\nPosted by: Gallery90 | February 10, 2010 6:49 PM | Report abuse\n\nThe private sector includes McDonald's jobs and salaries. In the government we have contracted out all of those types of positions. The people picking up the trash, cleaning the bathrooms, cooking in the cafeteria, and even the secretarial support are all contractors. When those types of positions used to be filled with federal employees, it was more reasonable to compare the 'average' salary.\n\nPosted by: 1Reader | February 10, 2010 8:37 PM | Report abuse\n\nLet's see...hmmmm If I were in the private sector I would be making six figures doing the almost the exact same thing that I'm doing now and making less.

I accepted my current government job because I believe in public service, I like the work, and I appreciate the job security.\"\n\nIf i had a nickel for every private sector employee who took a \"Substantial Pay Cut\" to work for the Government I could retire today. Why is it that every office I have worked in as a federal employee the contractors spend at least 50% of the time in the office \"making contacts\" in order to become a fed? Why are at least 50% of the applicants I interview private sector employees. I became a fed and I remain a fed because of the stability, the work I do is challenging and fulfilling. Public service is great, but it was not part of my decision to remain a fed. Interesting how many people have negative comments only because they are unhappy that feds are forced to not work this week. Get over it.\n\nPosted by: grpthink | February 11, 2010 6:38 AM | Report abuse\n\nI wonder if Scott Brown will now ask his fellow Senators to forgo their automatic yearly pay raise, which they no longer even have to vote on. Aren't they public employees, too? Aren't their salaries paid for by the taxpayers, whether we voted for them or not? I don't know of many people who automatically get a raise year after year after year, regardless of how long they have been in a job, and regardless of how poorly they perform. Think I might run for a Senate seat. After all, I would only have to serve a single term ( and possibly not even have to complete the term) and I would get a pension, health benefits, etc., all at taxpayers expense. Pretty good deal if you ask me! Oh, of course, I forgot - Brown is talking about \"other people\" who shouldn't get much for doing their jobs. His comments don't apply to him.\n\nPosted by: United1Kathy | February 11, 2010 10:53 AM | Report abuse\n\nThis is a thoughtful op-ed with real data.

Ms. Dumakude was acquainted with only some of them but got to know the others quickly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey told me who they were, and I asked what stories can they tell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they started opening up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098O.K., I think we have a show.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Because this is what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking to do: To talk about, Why do we sing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe drew from herself and the other women songs that had personal meaning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is always a memory of a story that is attached to a song,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow tell me that story, and go back in time and remember what song was attached to that story. That is how the whole thing started.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe result is a wide-ranging evening of anecdotes and music that includes the Nina Simone song \u00e2\u0080\u009cFour Women\u00e2\u0080\u009d (one of Ms. Carter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contributions) and the defiant \u00e2\u0080\u009cAin\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Ms. Green). The show, which has recently been extended through December, also includes several songs from South Africa, sung in Zulu.\n\nThat involved a substantial learning curve for the four members not from South Africa. Ms. Dumakude recalled the moment when she introduced them to one particular song that included not only lyrics in Zulu but also complex syncopated rhythms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I sang it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand they looked at me like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you expecting us to sing what you just sang?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yeah.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 For me, it was to see if I could push the bar a little bit higher and in the midst of that add the harmonies, which are very challenging. But I remember when they finally got it together, they were so excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMs. Green smiled at the memory of learning the Zulu songs from Ms. Dumakude. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was laughing at me because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be looking right into her mouth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I wanted to see how she was forming her words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the process of sharing their stories and introducing one another to songs that held personal meaning, the women discovered connections that transcend geography, something they have now experienced with the audiences as well.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the thing that brought us together as we began to talk about our backgrounds, we realized that there were a lot of similarities between the things that happened in South Africa and the things that were happening here in the United States, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not really different,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Green said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when we talk to the audience, people come \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they may be European or Japanese or whatever \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know, there was something about what you said that connected.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAudiences also respond to the honesty of the show, which is symbolized by a sort of seventh cast member that Ms. Carter found she needed to help her get through the performances.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you mind if I bring my cane?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Dumakude recalled. Not at all, and now the cane is part of the act.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not hiding who we are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Dumakude said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are singers. We are grandmothers.

Biden Jr., who has been picked to run for vice president on the Democratic ticket.\n\nHe also said that the Bush administration had not communicated disappointment or signaled a decline in its support for him since he gave the order on Aug. 7 to attack Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital.\n\nHe said that while he might face pressures in the months ahead, as the effects of the war ripple through the economy, he said he expected to weather any troubles. \u201cThere has been tremendous solidarity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kremlin has characterized Mr. Saakashvili as delusional and dangerous.\n\nSitting in his office as he discussed the effects of the war \u2014 tens of thousands of refugees; the scattering of a national army that abandoned its dead and its hardware on the battlefield; the loss of territory to Russia and the hardening of separatist sentiment in the enclaves \u2014 he seemed prepared to resume the policies that had set Georgia and Russia at odds.\n\nHe also said that he had made a decision not to continue to fight Russia during the invasion, and not to have his army organize an insurgency against Russia, because he hoped to save the country.\n\n\u201cWe had a choice here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could turn this country into Chechnya \u2014 we had enough people and equipment to do that \u2014 or we had to do nothing and stay a modern European country.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEventually we would have chased them away, but we would have had to go to the mountains and grow beards.

Sure, apps have been around for a few years now. But in 2010, they went mainstream and became an industry of their own \u2014 moving beyond Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone onto Google Inc. Android devices and others.\n\nHere, in no particular order, are 10 smartphone apps that made impressions in 2010, in five of the hottest areas for app makers:\n\nAngry Birds (Rovio Ltd.; iPhone, 99 cents; Android, Free) was the top paid app in the iTunes store this year, prompting the question \u201cWhy do smart people love seemingly mindless games?\u201d The simple, physics-based game involves a series of avian kamikaze missions in which plump, ticked-off poultry are launched via slingshot at piles of green pigs.\n\nOther casual games caught our fancy too. In Fruit Ninja (Halfbrick; iPhone, Android, 99 cents), melons, apples, pineapples and other fruits are lobbed into the air, and the player must slice through them with a sword (producing a satisfying squelch) before they hit the ground. Cut the Rope (ZeptoLab; iPhone, 99 cents) is a deceptively tricky puzzle game that involves cutting a series of ropes to release candies into an eager pet monster\u2019s mouth. The company says the paid version has been downloaded more than 4 million times since it launched in October.\n\nWith smartphone cameras becoming increasingly high end, it\u2019s no surprise that some of the most popular apps of the year involved photography. Hipstamatic (Synthetic Corp; iPhone, $1.99) lets you give your iPhone photos a vintage, Polaroid-style panache with a variety of filters, film and flash options (some at a price).\n\nAnd Path (iPhone, Free), a new photo-sharing service that launched last month, pares down the social network to what it calls \u201cthe personal network.\u201d The app lets you tag and share photos with select groups of (no more than 50) friends, promoting the rather novel idea that not all sharing has to be open to the public.\n\nSeveral apps this year let shoppers use their smartphones not just to shop online, but also to interact with stores in the real world. Shopkick (iPhone, Android, Free) gives users points (called \u201ckickbucks\u201d) when they walk into participating stores (partners include Macys, Crate & Barrel and Target), pick up merchandise (by scanning the barcodes with their smartphone cameras) and make purchases. Kickbucks can then be redeemed for rewards like gift cards and merchandise. TheDealMap (iPhone, Android, Free) serves up an interactive map that shows users sales and promotions near where they are shopping. The app offers a variety of filters to customize the types of deals users want to see, such as restaurants, hotels and kid-oriented promotions.\n\nGoogle Voice finally made it to the iPhone this year, after a lengthy review process. The free app, which has been available on Android devices since 2009, lets users make calls (with cheap long distance rates), send and receive texts (free to and from U.S. numbers), and integrates other features from the Google Voice platform. And Internet telephone company Skype just released an update to its iPhone app that lets users make video calls over Wi-Fi and 3G networks. (Video calling is not yet available for the Android version.)\n\nGoogle Goggles, the free picture-searching app that lets users search the Web using photos they take with their smartphones, is an example of so-called \u201caugmented reality apps\u201d\u2014applications that let people use their smartphone to interact with the world around them. The Android app launched in December 2009, and Google rolled out a version for iPhone in October. The Android app has a translation feature (currently available in a limited version on iPhone) that you can use to take a picture of words and render the text into a different language.", "summary": "Apps went mainstream in 2010.

In an article published June 30 on IEEE Spectrum, a trade magazine on future technologies, Zehner analyzes existing research on everything from worldwide governmental subsidies to the disposal of batteries to assess the environmental cost of the full product life cycle of an electrical vehicle.\n\n\u201cIn a gut punch to electric-car advocates, it concluded that the vehicles\u2019 lifetime health and environmental damages (excluding long-term climatic effects) are actually greater than those of gasoline-powered cars,\u201d according to Zehner, who referenced the National Academy of the Sciences, a 150-year-old nonprofit society of distinguished scholars, who reported in 2010 that the most environmentally friendly car\u2014an oxymoron in Zehner\u2019s world\u2014is a small gas powered car with good gas mileage.\n\nCongress funded the exhaustive study, one of the most comprehensive of its kind. Zehner feels this adds legitimacy to his point that most other studies are sponsored by corporations and reported on by \u201cexperts...[who] seem to be unquestioned car enthusiasts.\u201d It\u2019s a stretch to call Congress unbiased, another reason why assessing the true environmental costs of a vehicle's product life cycle is difficult to calculate.\n\nConsidering future developments and efficiencies, Zehner, and the National Academy, prefer not to look into the future.\n\n\u201cRight now, the National Academy is not convinced that those tech developments in the grid are enough to produce a benefit of EVs over gas,\u201d Zehner explains by phone.\n\nThis is not the kind of news welcomed by an estimated 116,000 electric car buyers. Mass production of electric vehicles began in earnest in late 2010 with the release of the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt. Earlier that year the National Academy of Sciences released \u201cHidden Costs of Energy: Unpriced Consequences of Energy Production and Use.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prices of electric cars are still very high\u2014a reflection of the substantial material and fossil-fuel costs that accrue to the companies constructing them,\u201d Zehner writes. While the price of EVs continue to drop, automakers aren\u2019t making money on electric vehicles.\n\nYet, it\u2019s a great time to be an EV buyer, reported Joann Muller for Forbes. Because of federally-mandated CAFE targets of 54 mpg for 2025, and because California has mandated that 15% of all vehicles sold in the state be zero emission by 2025, and because of the specter of greenhouse-gas induced climate change, the race for greater fuel economy has never been more urgent.\n\nEV buyers get a $7,500 federal tax credit, and a host of state incentives, like a $4,000 rebate and reduced registration fees in Illinois. The costs would have to come down organically, to use a phrase, without significant governmental subsidies. \u201cThese are much larger, on a per-vehicle comparison than subsidies arising from gasoline,\u201d Zehner says.\n\nIn the past three years, however, the single highest cost of an electric vehicle, its battery, has dropped on average 40 percent, according to a host of sources. Technological advancement and competitive pricing wars have conspired to drop EV prices to near gas-powered equivalents.\n\nBut are they in fact \u201cgreen\u201d?\n\nThe lack of noise pollution and tailpipe emissions make electric vehicles appear to be the greenest thing on the road aside from the traffic light. Significant environmental costs of an electric vehicle arise from manufacturing everything from lightweight frame material to the rare earth metals in lithium ion battery packs. Then there\u2019s the question of what is powering the electrical grid, and if the 44.5 percent of coal-fired power plants in the United States is clean coal or dirty coal or, as in most cases, a mix in transition.\n\nDon Anair, an engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists, which refutes Zehner\u2019s claims, reported that if you factor in operation and manufacturing, EVs in the United States have a significant environmental benefit, even with dirtier power sources, albeit marginal. The \u201ccleanest\u201d grid could produce emissions\u2019 savings of 58 percent compared to a gas-powered compact.\n\nAs the number of electric vehicles sold increases, the spotlight on the grid increases as well. Energy consciousness at one level would spill over into other levels. Scientists can\u2019t calculate psychology, however. Numbers make for the most convincing argument, but even the hard facts of numbers are unreliable.\n\n\u201cWhen you go so far upstream, you get lost in the analysis,\u201d says Brad Berman, editor of plugincars.com. There are so many factors that determine greenness, from driving style to energy source, that the direction we\u2019re taking is what\u2019s most important, Berman says.\n\nBerman is a living example of the factors that determine greenness. He was speaking from his 2006 Toyota Prius hybrid on his way from Berkeley to San Jose, a 45-mile journey. He might\u2019ve taken his 2011 Nissan Leaf but didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be around long enough to charge it. Factoring in those individual decisions, and how the individual drives, have a much greater impact on greenness as measured by fuel economy than by the macroeconomic considerations Zehner is referencing. Berman allows that in some circumstances, in some areas, a small fuel-efficient gas powered car might be the most fuel efficient.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the auto industry as mandated by law is we\u2019re moving toward greater efficiency,\u201d Berman says, citing that if he had to pick a leader it would be EVs. \u201cThe efficiency of electric vehicle powertrains is the gold standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unanswered questions,\u201d Zehner says. His article was extrapolated from his book, \u201cGreen Illusions,\u201d an award-winning environmental book about the true costs of clean energy and the state of the environmental movement. The \u201cillusions\u201d are the unproven environmental benefits of solar cells and electric vehicles, according to Zehner. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a benefit to fixating on illusions,\u201d he says, referring to his extensive article, which references a dozen conflicting studies and cites everything from Justin Bieber\u2019s greenness to solar cell life span.\n\n\u201cMine is an unpopular stance, to be sure,\u201d Zehner admits. He is asking questions more than answering them. \u201cAre electric cars a sleight of hand that allows peace of mind for those who are already comfortable at the expense of intensifying asthma, heart problems, and radiation risks among the poor and politically disconnected?\u201d\n\nThis stance advocates for taking taxpayer money away from a questionable environmental policy and putting it towards those with proven ecological benefits. Zehner advocates for putting money back into Safe Routes to School, a project by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration to create safe zones around schools to encourage walking and bike riding over driving. The focus on the local level was a huge success, says Zehner, but was gutted to subsidize EVs.\n\nZehner is not a bike zealot or an environmental iconoclast. He is a conservationist that understands the value of cars in American culture. Though he commutes with public transit in Berkeley, he has a 1995 Nissan pickup \u201cfor moving stuff around.\u201d Twenty years ago, way ahead of the curve, he built a natural gas hybrid plug-in that didn\u2019t go very far for very long.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything against EVs personally,\u201d Zehner says, admitting that they\u2019re fun to drive. \u201cI just don\u2019t think they\u2019re green.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to clean up one smokestack than a thousand tailpipes,\u201d Berman counters. \u201cThat\u2019s what grid energy for vehicles promises, a pathway, a direction forward.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a hotly contested debate, but the growing perception of energy use and its consequence is inarguable. How individuals choose to demonstrate that energy-mindedness is another question.\n\n\u201cThese technologies [solar cells and electric cars] have been tattooed into the flesh of the movement,\u201d Zehner says. \u201cThe argument I\u2019m making is that we need more than just tattoos.\u201d", "summary": "Considering cradle to grave life cycle of an electric vehicle, authorities weigh in on what is the most fuel efficient vehicle and least damaging to the environment.", "density": 29.0, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 55.4137931034, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2014/03/31/these-27-luxe-spring-shoes-are-anything-but-shy-2/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2014040219id_/http://nypost.com/2014/03/31/these-27-luxe-spring-shoes-are-anything-but-shy-2/", "title": "Luxe spring shoes that are anything but shy", "date": "2014040219", "text": "Manolo Blahnik for Zac Posen satin heels, $1,025 at Manolo Blahnik, 31 W. 54th St.\n\nSatin pumps with Swarovski crystal ball, $950 at Nicholas Kirkwood, 807 Washington St.\n\nSatin pumps, $775 at Oscar de la Renta, 772 Madison Ave.\n\nSilk satin mule heels, $555 at Sportmax, 450 West Broadway\n\nPython pumps, $625 at stuartweitzman.com\n\nGianvito Rossi leather sandals, $985 at neimanmarcus.com\n\nSuede-and-leather sandals, $1,995 at brianatwood.com\n\nPatent leather boots, $850 at ralphlauren.com\n\nSophia Webster patent leather sandals, $570 at neimanmarcus.com\n\nBejeweled snakeskin sandals, $1,300 at renecaovilla.com\n\nEmbossed leather heels, $1,395 at Proenza Schouler, 121 Greene St.\n\nSuede-and-feather sandals, $1,895 at jimmychoo.com\n\nStudded python booties, $2,250 at Salvatore Ferragamo, 655 Fifth Ave.\n\nCasadei studded leather sandals, $1,250 at amazon.com\n\nLeather sandals, $925 at Tod\u2019s, 650 Madison Ave.\n\nLeather-and-suede heels, $1,225 at Giorgio Armani, 760 Madison Ave.\n\nSergio Rossi leather sandals, $1,695 at Bloomingdale\u2019s, 1000 Third Ave.\n\nCotton heels, $1,115 at dsquared2.com\n\nPVC heels, $865 at Christian Louboutin, 59 Horatio St.\n\nPrinted cotton slingbacks, $695 at jeromecrousseau.com\n\nAperla\u00ef Paris suede heels, $1,000 at beigestore.com (available in April)\n\nValentino crystal-coated heels, $1,595 at Saks Fifth Avenue, 611 Fifth Ave.\n\nGivenchy lace-and-leather booties, $1,450 at Bergdorf Goodman.\n\nPrinted pumps, $775 at Roger Vivier, 750 Madison Ave.\n\nLeather sandals, $775 at jasonwustudio.com\n\nPython sandals, $1,150 at Gucci, 725 Fifth Ave.\n\nLeather pumps, $795 at Alexander Wang, 103 Grand St. Fashion Editor: Serena French Deputy Fashion Editor: Anahita Moussavian Fashion Assistants: Bree Bonagofsky & Teresa Yorkgitis Photos by: Brian Zak\n\nCaptain America visits the New York Stock Exchange, President Obama...\n\nA baby bear gets playful, the United States and South...\n\nFrom sky-high heels to bold details and vibrant hues, this...\n\nReady to forget snow boots?

It seeks a court order allowing Peta to administer all proceeds from the photos for the benefit of the monkey, which it identified as six-year-old Naruto, and other crested macaques living in a reserve on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.\n\nThe photos were taken during a 2011 trip to Sulawesi by British nature photographer David Slater. Through San Francisco-based self-publishing company Blurb, he has published a book called Wildlife Personalities that includes the \u201cmonkey selfie\u201d photos.\n\nHowever, the photos have been widely distributed elsewhere by outlets, including Wikipedia, which contend that no one owns the copyright to the images because they were taken by an animal, not a person. Slater, who is exploring legal action against some of those outlets, said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d by Peta\u2019s lawsuit because he considers himself an advocate of animal rights.\n\nLast year, the US Copyright Office issued an updated compendium of its policies, including a section stipulating that it would register copyrights only for works produced by human beings. It specified that works produced by animals, whether a photo taken by a monkey or a mural painted by an elephant, would not qualify.\n\nHowever, Jeffrey Kerr, a lawyer with Peta, said the copyright office policy \u201cis only an opinion\u201d, and the US Copyright Act itself does not contain language limiting copyrights to humans.\n\n\u201cThe act grants copyright to authors of original works, with no limit on species,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cCopyright law is clear: it\u2019s not the person who owns the camera, it\u2019s the being who took the photograph.\u201d\n\nCiting Slater\u2019s own written accounts of his encounter with the macaques, the lawsuit asserts that Naruto \u201cauthored the monkey selfies by his own independent, autonomous actions in examining and manipulating Slater\u2019s unattended camera\u201d.\n\nSlater has been openly dismayed by the prolonged dispute over the photos, and says the British copyright obtained for the photos by his company, Wildlife Personalities Ltd, should be honored worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe facts are that I was the intellect behind the photos, I set the whole thing up,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cA monkey only pressed a button of a camera set up on a tripod \u2013 a tripod I positioned and held throughout the shoot.\u201d\n\nLast year, as the dispute simmered, Slater offered copies of a \u201cmonkey selfie\u201d photo to purchasers willing to pay only for shipping and handling, and said he would donate $1.70 from each order to a conservation project dedicated to protecting Sulawesi\u2019s macaques. But he also has defended his right to make money from the photos.\n\n\u201cI sincerely wish my five-year-old daughter to be able to be proud of her father and inherit my copyrights so that she can make my work into an asset and inheritance and go to university,\u201d he wrote in his email. \u201cI have very little else to offer her.\u201d\n\nRelated: Wikipedia's monkey selfie ruling is a travesty for the world's monkey artists | Sarah Jeong\n\nPeta has on occasion pursued lawsuits that were widely viewed by other legal experts as offering little chance of success \u2013 for example, a 2011 lawsuit accusing the SeaWorld parks of keeping five killer whales in conditions that violate the US constitution\u2019s ban on slavery. A federal judge dismissed the suit, saying the 13th amendment applied only to humans.\n\nRegarding the new lawsuit, Kerr said Peta \u201chas a very strong case\u201d that Naruto should be declared the photo\u2019s owner. The selfies were introduced as exhibits in the suit.\n\nJoining Peta in the suit is Antje Engelhardt, a primatologist from Germany who has studied the Sulawesi macaques.\n\nDavid Favre, a Michigan State University law professor who often writes about animal rights, said by email that the copyright issue raised by Peta \u201cis a cutting-edge legal question\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey have a fair argument,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I would have to say it is an uphill battle.\u201d\n\nCheryl Dancey Balough, a Chicago lawyer who specializes in copyright law, said a key question \u2013 if the lawsuit moves forward \u2013 is whether Slater\u2019s creative contribution to the selfies rises to a level that warrants a copyright.\n\nLaurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who supports animal rights, expressed misgivings about the litigation.\n\n\u201cIt trivializes the terrible problems of needless animal slaughter and avoidable animal exploitation worldwide for lawyers to focus so much energy and ingenuity on whether monkeys own the copyright in selfies taken under these contrived circumstances,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Animal rights group contends six-year-old Naruto should receive all proceeds from photos for the benefit of crested macaques living in reserve in Indonesia", "density": 3.4444444444, "coverage": 0.8518518519, "compression": 35.0, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/sports/baseball/21bonds.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2009022119id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/sports/baseball/21bonds.html", "title": "The New York Times", "date": "2009022119", "text": "The ruling excludes lab results and log sheets seized from Balco that federal investigators say show Bonds had steroids in his urine in 2000 and 2001, as well as doping calendars seized from Anderson\u2019s home that were supposedly used to keep track of Bonds\u2019s use of human growth hormone and steroids.\n\nThe government had argued that a Balco employee, James Valente, would testify that Anderson had told him the test results belonged to Bonds, but Illston ruled that such testimony would be hearsay and not allowed in her court. Prosecutors, who declined to comment Friday, must decide before a jury is sworn in whether to appeal the case. The appeal would be heard by a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and it would probably take at least a month, if not longer, to decide the issue, several lawyers said.\n\nAn appeal could also give the government more time to persuade Anderson to testify. The authorities have stepped up the pressure on Anderson by threatening to charge his wife, Nicole Gestas, with criminal conspiracy and his mother-in-law with financial wrongdoing.\n\nMurphy said there was little indication that Anderson would have a change of heart.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who went to jail for a year,\u201d she said. \u201cShort of having him arrested again, there\u2019s not much pressure that they can\u2019t put on him next week that they can put on months from now.\u201d\n\nIf Anderson does not change his mind, Illston has indicated she would be reluctant to send him back to jail.\n\nEarlier this week, she raised her voice when she asked a government lawyer if he knew of a case in which a witness was jailed twice for refusing to testify. When the lawyer said he knew of no such example, Illston replied, \u201cNeither have I.\u201d\n\nIf government lawyers forgo an appeal and proceed with the case, they will be left with the testimony of several witnesses who prosecutors say have first-hand knowledge of Bonds\u2019s steroid use.\n\nThe government has said that it plans to call Kathy Hoskins, Bonds\u2019s former personal shopper, who is expected to testify that she saw Bonds being injected by Anderson.\n\nAlso on the witness list is her brother, Steve Hoskins, a childhood friend and former business partner of Bonds\u2019s who prosecutors say will testify that Bonds acknowledged to him that he used steroids.\n\nIllston also ruled that prosecutors would be allowed to play a portion of a secretly taped conversation between Steve Hoskins and Anderson that was supposedly taped in March 2003 in the San Francisco Giants\u2019 locker room. The government has said the tape includes Anderson saying that the substances Bonds was using were undetectable and that he injected him in different places to prevent infections.\n\nThe government will also be able to use as evidence a test result that shows the presence of the designer steroid THG, known as the clear, and a form of testosterone not naturally produced by the body. Those results come from a 2003 sample of Bonds\u2019s urine that had previously not tested positive for steroids under baseball\u2019s drug-testing program. The test was seized by federal authorities and showed evidence of the drugs when retested.\n\nMurphy said the value of the witnesses\u2019 testimony would hinge on whether they could specify the time when Bonds supposedly used steroids. In addition, she said, the government\u2019s challenge is to show that when Bonds made the statements to the grand jury, \u201cthey were not only not true, but they were not true and he knew they were not true.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Prosecutors May Appeal In Bonds\u2019s Perjury Case.

But the nation\u2019s constitutional council threw out the results from areas that supported Mr. Ouattara, claiming widespread fraud, leading to a prolonged standoff in which Mr. Gbagbo has refused to leave office, despite pressure from the African Union and other governments.\n\nA leading human rights group in Abidjan, along with Mr. Ouattara\u2019s camp, reported even higher death tolls among the demonstrators by midmorning Thursday, saying that more than 30 had been killed.\n\nA Gbagbo government police spokesman refused to confirm the death toll in a phone interview from Abidjan, saying: \u201cI know nothing about it.\u201d\n\nA reporter for The Associated Press in Abidjan described seeing the bodies of three men \u2014 one shot in the head, two others in the chest \u2014 in the streets of the rundown Abobo neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThere have already been a lot of deaths,\u201d said Drissa Traor\u00e9, head of the Ivorian Movement for Human Rights, the MIDH, in a phone interview from Abidjan. \u201cIn every neighborhood, the security forces are firing on people, and it\u2019s still going on. When I call people in the neighborhoods, I can hear gunshots,\u201d Mr. Traor\u00e9 said. \u201cThey are shooting with the intention to kill.\u201d\n\nClouds of smoke hung over several neighborhoods as tear gas canisters burned, The A.P. reported.\n\nDemonstrators confronted well-armed security forces across the city after Mr. Ouattara\u2019s prime minister, Guillaume Soro, called for a march on the headquarters of state-run television. Television broadcasts have become a powerful weapon in Mr. Gbagbo\u2019s fight to stay in office.\n\nMr. Ouattara\u2019s camp has been based in a hotel, protected by several platoons of United Nations troops, in an upscale Abidjan neighborhood. It was not immediately clear what role the United Nations troops were playing on Thursday; a spokesman for the international organization in Abidjan declined, for the moment, to take questions.\n\nMr. Gbagbo has found himself increasingly isolated politically, but has so far appeared unwilling to loosen his grip on power. Last week, the African Union suspended Ivory Coast until Mr. Gbagbo stepped down. The United States has said it would consider sanctions against Mr. Gbagbo, his family and supporters if he did not do so.\n\nSince the election, human rights advocates have raised concern that government death squads, present during the country\u2019s brutal civil war, were reappearing. Witnesses and advocates say squads of government security forces have targeted opposition activists and residents in neighborhoods known to support Mr. Ouattara.\n\nAt least 20 have been killed around the country, including nine in Abidjan alone, according to Amnesty International.\n\nAdam Nossiter reported from Dakar, Senegal, and J.

I don't want to rub people's noses in it.\"\n\nJill certainly isn't the only American with a healthy income who has felt the urge to cut back on spending. In September, U.S. consumer spending shrunk by 0.3% from August, despite the fact that personal income was up by 0.2%, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nEven though the Federal Reserve reported on Sept. 18 that U.S. household net worth dropped $2 trillion over the last year, it's still a whopping $17 trillion more than it was in 2002, which means that many people--despite a beyond-volatile market--are much richer than they were less than a decade ago. Yet the economic crisis has forced people--even the well-off--to rethink their shopping habits.\n\n\"We're way beyond the days of conspicuous consumption,\" says James Chung, president of Reach Advisors, a Slingerlands, N.Y.-based marketing strategy and research firm with clients in the luxury market.\n\n\"Anyone who knows me knows I love to shop,\" Jill says. \"But I'm just not doing it right now.\"\n\nGot It, Don't Flaunt It She's not the only one. In consumer surveys conducted by Reach Advisors, respondents are more frequently saying that they wouldn't recommend certain high-end goods or services to others since they don't want to flaunt their wealth. As a result, phrases like \"stealth wealth,\" or discreet luxury, have been floating around marketing circles.\n\nThat means luxury goods companies must find new ways to lure consumers. For some, brands with less of a \"look at me\" attitude are the answer.\n\nTake luxury giant PPR. While Gucci , the company's marquee brand, still saw overall sales increase by 6.8% over the first nine months of 2008, compared with the first nine months of 2007, its less ostentatious labels saw a much bigger increase.\n\nBottega Veneta--whose original tag line in the 1970s was \"When Your Initials Are Enough\"--saw a 20% increase in sales for the first nine months of 2008. Yves Saint Laurent--with the help of its highly lauded, innovative-yet-understated creative director, Stefano Pilati--saw sales rise by 26.6%, compared with the first nine months of 2007. In the third quarter alone, YSL saw an increase of 27.4% worldwide, compared with the third quarter of 2007.\n\nThink about it this way: If a person buys a monogrammed Gucci handbag, or diamond earrings shaped like Chanel's double Cs, everyone knows where she made the purchase. If, instead, she chooses one of Bottega Veneta's braided satchels, or a handbag from Proenza Schouler's new line--which has no visual branding--she doesn't look like she's showing off.\n\n\"Right now, people are more apt to buy things that promise longer durability, instead of relying on faddish things from year to year,\" says Ron Kurtz, founder of Alpharetta, Ga.-based market-research firm the American Affluence Research Center.\n\nA Personal Touch Another example of understated luxury is Denyse Schmidt's patchwork quiltdesigns. The quilts are special because they're hand-quilted by Amish craftswomen with pre-washed, fine cotton fabrics. Personal fabrics, such as a favorite T-shirt, can be incorporated into Schmidt's design upon request. Sure, they cost upward of $6,000, but only you will know uniqueness of the blanket draping your rocking chair.\n\nWhich do you opt for in down times, discreet luxury or simple essentials? Weigh in. Add your thoughts in the Reader Comments section below.\n\nAnd while Alexander McQueen's designs for luggage maker Samsonite (otcbb: SAMC.OB - news - people )--which include a white crocodile-print rolling bag--are head-turning, a plain black bag from Tumi might be more functional and less extravagant. Outfitted in nearly indestructible ballistic nylon, the brand's Regent bag features a removable garment sleeve, interior pockets and a strap for additional luggage to be attached. At $1,195 Tumi's case costs about $200 more than McQueen's, but its understated elegance makes the price tag worth it for many.\n\nSo there are options out there for people like Jill S. And make no mistake, discreet luxury isn't a passing trend, according to the market researchers we spoke with. Regardless of whether or not overall consumer confidence bounces back in 2009, toning down outlandish spending is here to stay, at least for a while. \"This is a real, permanent thing, not a seasonal issue,\" says Chung. \"It's no longer cool to spend like that anymore.\"\n\nIn Depth: Ten Ways To Buy Luxury, Discreetly", "summary": "The financial crisis has made conspicuous consumption gauche.

Price, whose son Byron Price, a 31-year-old construction manager for the family business who was working nearby and was stabbed when he heroically intervened, suspects the White House's reluctance to identify acts of radical Islamic terror has trickled down to investigators who are still probing the Merced attack.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just call it what it is -- domestic terrorism?\" said Price. \"Everyone is afraid to be politically incorrect. I do believe in law enforcement and believe they will do their job, but it seems like to me we aren\u2019t getting the whole story. I just wonder how much of this is driven from way higher up and is politically driven -- I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just call it what it is - domestic terrorism? Everyone is afraid to be politically incorrect.\"\n\n- John Price, father of stabbing victim\n\nMohammad, whose victims all survived, left behind a rambling, two-page manifesto in which he instructed himself to \u201cpraise Allah\u201d as he worked his way through his hit list, a photocopied ISIS flag and at least one shaken roommate who remembers him as a menacing loner.\n\n\u201cHe was a loner and an extreme Muslim,\u201d Ali Tarek Elshekh, Mohammad\u2019s roommate, told Merced Sheriff\u2019s Department Detective Jose Silva in a statement, also noting Mohammad was \u201cway out there.\u201d\n\nElshekh, who is Muslim, told sheriffs that a friend of his had asked Mohammad what would happen if he touched the mat he used for praying, and got a chilling response.\n\n\u201cI will kill you,\u201d Mohammad calmly vowed, in what Elshekh said was not a \u201cnormal\u201d response for a Muslim.\n\nElshekh, whose statement was included in a warrant obtained by FoxNews.com through a Freedom of Information Act request from the Merced Superior Court, said he last saw Mohammad just minutes before the attack, sitting on his bed in their dorm room, dressed in a hooded sweater, hood over his face, with his backpack on his back, staring straight ahead in silence.\n\nThe warrant, which authorized detectives to search Mohammad's dorm, car and other possessions, showed investigators found a second copy of the manifesto in Mohammad\u2019s garbage can, along with several discarded petroleum jelly cans, duct tape wrappers, large zip ties, a package that had contained a knife and sharpener, a red prayer rug and a copy of the Koran.\n\nAuthorities believe Mohammad, who carried out his attack with an 8-inch hunting knife, planned to steal a gun by overpowering a campus cop and then take several more victims. Price was credited with slowing his attack, providing a chance for others to escape and helping to ensure that police ended the onslaught before anyone was killed. To his father, Price helped stop a terrorist.\n\nThe hesitance to call a crime \u201cterrorism\u201d is a familiar scenario replayed last week some 326 miles south in San Bernardino, where authorities took several days to ascribe terrorism as the motivation for an attack despite what seemed like overwhelming evidence. And while authorities, including President Obama, have now said the attack that left 14 dead in San Bernardino was a terrorist act, the motive for Mohammad\u2019s spree, which resulted in no fatalities, remains unattributed.\n\nThe manifesto authored by the 18-year-old freshman, copies of which were found both on his body during the autopsy and in the trash can in his dorm, bore names of his targets, a vow \u201cto cut someone\u2019s head off\u201d and as many as five reminders to \u201cpraise Allah.\u201d\n\nHe detailed how he wanted to behead, stab and shoot his victims, Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke told FoxNews.com, in an earlier interview.\n\n\u201cNo. 27 was to \u2018make sure people are tied down,\u2019 No. 28 was \u201csit down and praise Allah,'\u201d Warnke said. \u201cI remember seeing four or five times, scribbled on the side of the two-page manifesto, where he wrote something like \u2018praise Allah.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a gruesome statement he made about wanting to cut someone\u2019s head off and kill two people with one bullet, and he planned to shoot the police,\u201d Warnke said. \u201cHe did not have a firearm with him and didn\u2019t seem to have a lot of experience with firearms because he thought he could kill two people with one bullet. He reminded himself in the list to raise the gun slowly. He scripted everything out in chronological order.\u201d\n\nWarnke, initially involved in the case, told FoxNews.com weeks ago that his office would release the manifesto to the press after the sheriff\u2019s role in investigation wrapped up, but the sheriff\u2019s department has since withdrawn from the investigation, leaving it to the UC Merced Police Department and the FBI, and Warnke is no longer responding to media requests from FoxNews.com.\n\nA spokeswoman for the FBI in Sacramento would not provide any information other than to report, \u201cthe investigation is ongoing.\u201d Neither UC Merced police, the lead agency on the case, nor the university\u2019s administration, have made public the manifesto or the copy of the Islamic State flag Mohammad was reportedly carrying, despite repeated requests from FoxNews.com, also maintaining the investigation still continues.\n\n\u201cIt seems like people way higher up are not taking this as seriously as they should, at best, and, at worst, they are deliberately ignoring what has really happened for political reasons,\u201d Price said. \u201cEven if Faisal Mohammad is only one individual, his aim was to cause terror, and while it may not have been commanded by ISIS, the group inspired him.\u201d", "summary": "The California college student who stabbed four people last month in a campus spree that ended when he was killed by campus police was described by his roommate as an extreme Muslim and carried an Islamist manifesto and a photo-copied ISIS flag, more than enough to convince John Price he was a terrorist.", "density": 17.1578947368, "coverage": 0.9473684211000001, "compression": 20.9122807018, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/2-endangered-African-penguin-chicks-hatch-at-Cal-5902512.php", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2014111919id_/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/2-endangered-African-penguin-chicks-hatch-at-Cal-5902512.php", "title": "2 African penguin chicks hatch at Academy of Sciences", "date": "2014111919", "text": "Photo: Courtesy / California Academy Of Sciences\n\nTwo African penguin chicks, members of an endangered species, hatched at the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park Nov. 1 and 4, 2014.\n\nTwo African penguin chicks, members of an endangered species,...\n\nIn this Nov. 17, 2014 photo, California Academy of Sciences biologist Crystal Crimbchin weighs one of two African penguin chicks after it was examined at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.

The Capitals have one spot open on the 23-man active roster, but according to Capgeek.com they do not have the space under the salary cap to accommodate Erskine ($1,962,500 cap hit) and would need to make a move in order to activate the defenseman off LTIR.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make decisions, they\u2019re never easy,\u201d Oates said. \u201cObviously he\u2019s an important part of our team, so we\u2019ve got to get him in there.\u201d\n\nErskine, 33, underwent arthroscopic surgery on his knee in the offseason and clearly labored through the first four games of the season.

They protect your health as much as quitting smoking and a great deal more than exercising, according to a large 2010 review in the journal PLOS One. More research has shown that socially isolated people are more than twice as likely to die from heart disease as those with a solid social circle.\n\n\u201cStrong social relationships support mental health, and that ties into better immune function, reduced stress and less cardiovascular activation,\u201d says Dr. Debra Umberson, a sociologist at the University of Texas, Austin. Umberson says emotional support is just one of a dozen ways friends may safeguard your health and extend your life.\n\nMORE Here\u2019s How Hugs Can Prevent the Flu\n\nUnfortunately, though, many of us don\u2019t have enough of them. According to data from the General Social Survey (GSS), the number of Americans who say they have no close friends has roughly tripled in recent decades. \u201cZero\u201d is also the most common response when people are asked how many confidants they have, the GSS data show. And adult men seem to be especially bad at keeping and cultivating friendships.\n\nThat may seem strange in the era of Facebook, Twitter and boundless digital connectivity. But the \u201cfriends\u201d orbiting at the farthest reaches of your digital galaxy aren\u2019t the ones that matter when it comes to your health and happiness.\n\nThe vital friendships\u2014the pals you hug and laugh and lament with\u2014are the ones who have the greatest impact on your health and happiness. You need between three and five of them for optimal wellbeing, suggests research from Dr. Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford.\n\nDunbar\u2019s name comes up a lot when you start digging into the subject of friendship. From his early work studying the brains and social circles of primates, he recognized that the size of a human\u2019s social network might be limited by the size of a certain part of the human brain called the neocortex, a critical site for higher brain functions. After some complicated study, he came up with a figure now known as \u201cDunbar\u2019s number.\u201d\n\nThat number\u2014usually cited as 150, but actually a range between 100 and 200\u2014is the approximate size of a person\u2019s social circle, or the perpetually changing group of friends and family members that you would invite to a large party. While you may have far fewer than 150 of these people in your life, your brain really can\u2019t hold a close connection with more than 150, Dunbar\u2019s research shows. Within that group, he says your closest 15 relationships\u2014including family members or \u201ckin\u201d\u2014seem to be most crucial when it comes to your mental and physical health.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say a brother or sister offers you the same benefits as a close friend, Dunbar says. While your kin are more likely to be there for you when you need help, your good friends tend to fire up your nervous system and trigger the release of feel-good neuropeptides called endorphins. Whether you\u2019re laughing with your pal or feeling him or her touch your shoulder in sympathy, the resulting rush of endorphins seems to \u201ctune\u201d up your immune system, protecting you from disease, Dunbar explains.\n\nSo yes, for the sake of your health, you need friends\u2014ideally the really close kind you see face-to-face on a regular basis. But even one very good friend can improve your life in profound ways, says Dr. Mark Vernon, a philosopher, psychotherapist and author of The Meaning of Friendship.\n\nDespite their value in terms of your health and wellbeing, don\u2019t think of them as your personal social doctors. Vernon warns against turning your friends into what he calls \u201cservice providers\u201d\u2014that\u2019s not what friendship should be about, he says, even if your pals are good for you.\n\nIn the end, Vernon says Ralph Waldo Emerson may have offered the best advice when it comes to making and keeping close pals: \u201cThe only way to have a friend is to be one.\u201d\n\nRead next: 5 Types of Friends That Everyone Has\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.", "summary": "Maybe just a handful, though quality trumps quantity.", "density": 0.7000000000000001, "coverage": 0.5, "compression": 80.4, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://mashable.com/2013/12/06/customer-acquisition-metrics/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2013120619id_/http://mashable.com/2013/12/06/customer-acquisition-metrics/", "title": "How to Drive Successful Customer Acquisition", "date": "2013120619", "text": "Pardon the graphic references, but they cut to the heart, so to speak, of one of the most important goals of your business: drawing in new customers. But how do you convince folks to do what you want them to do \u2014 namely, buy your products and services \u2014 and keep them coming back for more?\n\nConsider the weight not only of today's purchase, veteran marketers say, but the benefit of brand building for the long term.\n\n\"We're always asking, 'What's the lifetime value of a customer?'\" says Deborah Lammon, SVP, Portfolio Partner at UM, which handles Sony Pictures Entertainment and Electronics accounts. \"We want to engage that person, not just once, but over a long period of time, maybe the lifetime of a franchise.\"\n\nCustomer acquisition may be part art and part science, with gut instinct still factoring in, but there are some best practices that can set you apart from the masses.\n\nFirst impressions are everything, say executives at female-targeted lifestyle digital publication PureWow, who stress that the landing page \u2014 the web address that acts as your front door \u2014 needs to be attention-grabbing, uncluttered and bold.\n\n\"We A/B test landing pages like crazy and are in a constant state of design and redesign with landing page templates to ensure we capture all users across all devices,\" says Alexis Anderson, PureWow\u2019s director of marketing and partnerships. \"We pour tremendous time and energy into driving qualified users to our landing pages to sign up for email. If they don\u2019t take the last step to actually enter their email address, it's a waste.\"\n\nFrom extensive research and tinkering, Anderson came up with a few tips for that initial point of contact:\n\nMake it clean and simple-to-use\n\nOffer a clear call to action and robust incentives\n\nIncluding a demo video on the landing page can increase conversions by 10 - 20%, according to Renee Warren, co-founder of Onboardly, a consultancy for tech startups. Glowing endorsements from satisfied customers can also mean the difference between a looky-loo and a buyer, she says.\n\nTo get the most from that early outreach, a marketer needs to consider where the consumer is in the conversion funnel, says Dave Martin, SVP of media at Ignited, a Los Angeles-based ad agency. Native ads, short-form content and other awareness builders can kick off the relationship for the uninitiated. If the potential buyer is already leaning toward your brand, having expressed interest or shopped your site in the past, it's time to target that person with a promotion or special offer, he says.\n\n\"There needs to be an incentive to close the deal,\" Martin says. \"And the smoother the process is from the first time you touch a consumer to the point that he hands you his credit card, the more likely that consumer is to convert.\"\n\nFor client Fresh & Easy, for instance, Ignited put \"geofences\" around its small grocery stores and sent out discounts and coupons via mobile and digital ads to consumers who were within a mile of the locations. Getting people into the stores so they could experience its European-style do-it-yourself format was the top priority, Martin says. The results were \"better than expected\" and outperformed advertising on other media platforms.\n\nTo combat so-called \"banner blindness,\" where consumers have trained their eyes to skip over omnipresent banner ads, Ignited has sent tailored ads to the 18-to-35-year-old consumers who have shopped vacations with its client, Contiki Travel.\n\n\"We've collected the data, and then we made the most of it,\" Martin says. \"It's about retargeting with dynamic creative and discounts.\"\n\nUM\u2019s Lammon agrees, saying it's a mistake to talk to all potential customers in the same way.\n\n\"The message needs to feel like it's specific to that person,\" she says. \"Tailor it as much as the technology you're using will allow.\"\n\nLammon's group focuses mostly on massive-scaling social networks these days, such as Facebook, Vine, Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter, to draw in audiences for Sony products like the feature film The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Vaio.\n\n\"We're looking for resonance, not just impressions,\" she says, \"because we want the message to spread beyond the initial customers we're reaching out to. We want it to extend through their social networks.\"\n\nThough her group gathers reams of data, Lammon cautions against relying too heavily on numbers. To avoid getting \"bogged down in data,\" she always injects the human touch. \"You need great systems and technology that can help you dive in to the data,\" she says, \"but you need humans, live brains making decisions.\"\n\nKnowing your consumers is one thing, respecting them is another, with Martin pointing to a current trend of marketers disguising advertising as content or making big, hollow offers to try to snag site traffic.\n\n\"If the consumer clicks on something that promises a $100 discount, and they get to the (landing) page and it's actually a buy-one-get-one offer, they're gone,\" Martin says. \"It\u2019s the same if they think they\u2019re going to read an article or watch a video and instead they get thrown to a sell page.

The March 25th New York Times features an excellent example of such an entrepreneur, Gilad Elbaz.\n\nElbaz\u2019s current start-up, Factual, aims to store all the world\u2019s facts. Elbaz had already sold his first start-up, Applied Semantics, to Google (GOOG) for cash and stock that made Elbaz\u2019s net worth soar into the \u201chundreds of millions [of dollars].\u201d\n\nSo in 2009, when he went to Andreesen Horowitz for capital, Elbaz needed to persuade name partner, Ben Horowitz, that Elbaz\u2019s wealth had not sated his start-up hunger.\n\nElbaz got Horowitz to believe that Factual would yield an attractive return on Horowitz\u2019s investment \u2014 or as he told the Times, this was not a \u201ctoo-rich-to-work-hard\u201d problem. As Horowitz said, \u201cI asked him, \u2018Aren\u2019t you too rich to build this company?\u2019 He gave me one of the longest and most thought-out answers I\u2019d ever heard. He thinks this is a chance to change the world \u2014 that matters to him more than money,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nMy guess is that Elbaz did not have enough money to finance Factual all by himself or that he had other reasons to hedge his bet. So why did Elbaz need the money and why was he so committed to making Factual succeed? Elbaz told Horowitz that the cash was \u201can incentive for the engineers\u201d and that he needed to do Factual now, because the 34-year-old Elbaz wanted to \u201dreach his goal while his mind was still strong enough,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nStill not convinced that entrepreneurs don\u2019t care about money? Of course, they need money to pay people who don\u2019t have enough to quit working for the rest of their lives. But an even better example of an entrepreneur who does not care about money is Jeff Hammerbacher.\n\nAfter all, Hammerbacher was one of Facebook\u2019s first 100 employees and its first chief data scientist. In 2008, he walked away from the social network \u2014 leaving behind shares that would probably be worth plenty now if he had stuck around. Quitting the $100 billion (estimated market valuation) Facebook, he joked to me, was \u201can egregious act of wealth destruction.\u201d\n\nHammerbacher is a 2005 Harvard graduate who worked at Bear Stearns and Facebook before starting Cloudera in 2008. A Facebook colleague described Hammerbacher as \u201cscary smart, a maverick, individualistic, dynamic, a sponge when it comes to new ideas and his interests evolve quickly.\u201d\n\nWhen Hammberbacher started Cloudera, its mission was to apply the computing power he had built at Facebook to solve more important problems. Instead of helping to answer what a group of friends \u201clike\u201d the most on Facebook, Cloudera customers would be able to answer questions such as, \u201cWhat gene do all these cancer patients share?\u201d", "summary": "Image via CrunchBase In the research for my new book to be published this fall, Hungry Start-up Strategy: Creating New Ventures with Limited Resources and Unlimited Vision, one of the most surprising things I found is that entrepreneurs are not motivated primarily by money.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning. We are hours away from an important deadline involving five terrorists in the hands of a Mideast ally. And we still don't know their fate.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\nThe so-called Taliban 5 under virtual house arrest in Qatar for the past year, set to be released this week. So will they rejoin the terrorist army? I'll have a talk with the former prime minister of Qatar, shortly.\n\nPlus, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker sitting down with me one on one, revealing his timetable for 2016 presidential announcement. His thoughts on negotiating with Iran and the stance on gay marriage.\n\nPlus, the Senate working overtime to consider a bill that involves collecting your personal information. Our panel on the Patriot Act extension as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures.\n\nAnd we begin this morning with discussions going on right now to keep five senior Taliban leaders from returning to the fight. The Obama administration released the so-called Taliban 5 from Gitmo last year, in exchange for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. Bergdahl now faces desertion charges, and the U.S. and Qatar have agreed that the Taliban five would not travel with restrictions, but those restrictions expire tomorrow. A deal is now reportedly in the works to extend the restriction for another six months.\n\nJoining me right now in an exclusive interview, the former prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor al-Thani. Good to see you, Sheikh Hamad, thank you so much for joining us this morning.\n\nSHEIKH HAMAD BIN JASSIM BIN JABOR AL-THANI, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF QATAR: Thank you, Maria.\n\nBARTIROMO: What is your stance? The U.S. nearing this deal with Qatar to extend that travel ban. What's your sense of these five former prisoners now still in Qatar and whether or not they will leave and go rejoin the fight?\n\nAL-THANI: Well, first of all, I'm talking on my behalf, not on my government. As you know, I'm not in the government.\n\nBut I think this deal, when it's been reached, it's been reached in a mutual agreement between Qatar and the United States and the Taliban. And it was at that time trying to help both parties to reach an agreement on the prisoners. And also, as you know, there is political talks happened in Qatar between Taliban and the government, how they will find a way to sort the problem in Afghanistan, especially, as you know, United States, most of their troops are now outside Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is a care to me, first of all, is the noise (ph) which (ph) it happens. This agreement being done with the United States, as you know, Qatar respects the agreement and put these people. And at that time, everybody thought this is a good deal for everybody and it's a win-win situation.\n\nRight now I hear a lot of criticism about this deal. Criticism which we are surprised for in Qatar, as a normal person, as an ordinary person, that this deal is being done to help. And now it seems that if we did not help, it is better for me that we don't have that noise (ph).\n\nI know there is a discussion happening at the moment as we hear from the news, and I think there will be an agreement between Qatar and the United States and Taliban how to extend or have a new arrangement for these five Taliban.\n\nBARTIROMO: Is there a feeling within -- from the Qatari side that these five represent a big threat to the world? I mean, how much of a threat do you think these five represent?\n\nAL-THANI: Well, from the beginning before we go to the threat, we went -- this problem is to solve a problem. And the problem is to get the prisoner back, your prisoner.\n\nAL-THANI: Yes. And the second thing also is to keep them in a safe place, where you can guarantee that they will not behave or go back to what they are doing before. This has been done. This has been reached. Now the end of the one year is, after a few hours, as you mentioned --\n\nAL-THANI: So in my opinion, agreement is important to reach. How they will behave or how after they leave, this is something which we don't know, how they will behave. Because you cannot guarantee somebody else after he leave a jail, even if in the United States, what he will go and do the same things back or not.\n\nBARTIROMO: Of course, of course. Sheikh Hamad, I want to get your thoughts on the broader policy coming out of America, foreign policy as it relates to Yemen and Syria. So stay with us. We have got a lot to talk about with you, the former prime minister of Qatar. But first, let's take a look at the Taliban five. The renewed fear they will return to the battlefield and the questions of whether the prisoner swap was one of the biggest mistakes President Obama has made yet. Fox News' senior correspondent Eric Shawn joins me now live with that angle. Eric, good morning to you.\n\nERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone. How will they behave? Well, they will be back killing Americans. That at least is what critics predict will happen if the so- called Taliban five are free to travel after their one-year travel ban expires just hours from now tomorrow. But reports say the ban may be extended for at least another six more months.\n\nJOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It is true that the United States has been in touch with our partners in Qatar about the kinds of steps we believe are important to protecting the national security of the American people.\n\nSHAWN: They were described as high risk, hard core. The five former top- ranking Taliban officials. Among them, the chief of staff of the Taliban army, the head of communications, and the deputy of the Taliban intelligence service. They were held in Gitmo for 12 years, and it was predicted that they would return to the battlefield if ever released.\n\nBut then came Bowe Bergdahl. President Obama made that controversial and highly criticized decision to swap the five for Bergdahl one year ago. Bergdahl, of course, captured by the Taliban after walking away from his platoon, charged with desertion, and has been branded a traitor by some critics.\n\nWhen they were swapped, the Taliban five were sent to Qatar, living there, says the government, under surveillance and monitoring. But despite that, at least one of the Taliban five was reported to have contacted al Qaeda, which of course was not part of the plan. We were told that the five had been living in a residential compound in Doha, joined by 70 family members from Afghanistan. For now, they may not be going anywhere, but the question remains, what happens when the day comes that they can? Maria?\n\nBARTIROMO: And of course, that day is today. Eric, thank you very much. More now with former prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad. Joining me this morning in this exclusive. And Sheikh Hamad, I'd like to get your sense of really what's happening right now, with ISIS controlling 50 percent of Syria, with ISIS having taken down Ramadi in Iraq. Characterize the war against ISIS and what's been going on this last year in Yemen, as well as Syria.\n\nAL-THANI: Well, I think there is turmoil in all the region, and I think this is still in the beginning. I don't think we reached the peak in the region. There is a mess, and this mess is because of 40 years of bad policy in the region. Most of the region have bad policy for 40 years. We have dictatorships, which has stayed 40 years there. They most think about themselves, how to stay in power. They did not talk about job, about development, and that's what we have.\n\nIf we are talking about ISIS, we have to talk why it happens. It happens because of bad policy of our ally and United States, in my opinion. You know, the control of the Iraqi government, the way how it's been done, I think it shows that there is -- the Sunnis have not fair treatment with other ethnics or with the Shia in Iraq, and all of them Iraq, they have to have the same opportunity. And I believe this happened after feeling that they've been insulted or they've been pressured or been kicked out of the power completely. And unfortunately, ISIS finds the right moment and the right, what you call it, atmosphere in the region, and it happens.\n\nIn my opinion, to fight ISIS, there's two or three elements. The first element, we have to know the problem, why it's being caused. ISIS will not be strong if we dealt with the problem in Syria in the first year or the first eight months. And at that time, Bashar almost done.\n\nNow we are dealing -- we know that ISIS have some arrangement with Bashar al-Assad in certain times to create a new situation in Syria and to show you that the alternative of Bashar is terrorism. I think if we dealt with the problem more seriously, I mean the United States especially, dealt with us and the region more seriously, and Syria problem the first 10 or 12 months, I think we will not see ISIS.\n\nAnd also, if we dealt more seriously in the problem in Iraq. Right now, to deal with the matter, the United States cannot deal alone. All the region have to work on this. And to work on this, that means there should be an involvement to get (inaudible). Part of this involvement, how also to give the Syrian people their freedom from Bashar.\n\nBARTIROMO: Should the U.S. have pulled out all of the troops in Iraq? I mean, it feels like that was one of the seminal moments that really empowered ISIS.\n\nAL-THANI: I think it happens before you pull your troops. ISIS was there, not enough strong, but it was there because, in my opinion, during your stay, during your troop, yes, you can dealt with it militarily, but politically I think there was a lot of mistakes which bring ISIS to the picture.\n\nBARTIROMO: Do you think at this point we will see a change in strategy? How does the Middle East right now, our allies in the Middle East, feel about America's foreign policy? What would you like to see done?\n\nAL-THANI: I think there's a shock and surprise from the policy, to be frank. You know, I consider myself friend of United States. And I think there is a shock among even the friends of United States how they dealt with the matter, how they are trying to find solution after solution, mistakes after mistakes, I call it. And even when you are talking with Iran, for example, for the nuclear, I support to have a deal with Iran on the nuclear. But to support Iran and the nuclear, you have to have all the region with you before Camp David. You have to have them with you from day one to support this deal.\n\nBARTIROMO: Sheikh Hamad, before we go, I have to have ask you about this soccer corruption and FIFA. Let me switch gears, insisting that the Qatar 2022 World Cup will go ahead. Can you give us a sense of how the process has gone on in term of Qatar getting the World Cup? There's all this talk about FIFA and these under-the-table deals.\n\nHAMAD: Unfortunately, it's not fair talks. Even if you see how they talk about Russia and they talk about Qatar. I support, of course, Russia to have their turn in 2018. But if you see the talks, it's all about Qatar. Is it because an Arab Islamic small country? That's the people in the region feel.\n\nI think if you think about the opportunities and to bring the Middle East and to bring the Arabs closer to you, I don't think this attack will help, because my knowledge that we dealt with this in a fair competition and there was no corruption and these things.\n\nBut the problem is the media insisting, as there is somebody trying to flare this between time to time, and we know why they flare this. We know -- even we know how to distinguish this flare. But I believe that shows the ugly face of the other party when they did not win a fair competition.\n\nBARTIROMO: Sheikh Hamad, it's really terrific having you on the program today. Thanks so much for talking about so many important subjects of the day.\n\nBARTIROMO: We will see you soon.\n\nSheikh Hamad is the former prime minister of Qatar.\n\nWisconsin governor Scott Walker, meanwhile, eyeing a launch date for his 2016 campaign. When is the big day? What are his thoughts on Iran and gay marriage? He'll join me next.\n\nI hope you'll follow us on Twitter @MariaBartiromo @SundayFutures. Stay with us as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" this morning.\n\nThe IRS revealing this week that identity thieves stole sensitive tax information through its website. The agency says it affected about 100,000 U.S. households.\n\nNow, cyber intelligence sources telling Fox News the attack originated in Russia.\n\nWe bring in an online security expert. Right now Hemu Nigam joining he. He's the founder of SSP Blue and co-founder of very as well as a former federal sex crimes prosecutor.\n\nHemu, good to have you on the program. Thanks very much for joining us.\n\nHEMU NIGAM, ONLINE SECURITY EXPERT: Thanks, Maria.\n\nBARTIROMO: Hemu, I guess the one question to start out with is how is it that they did break the IRS website to get all of that personal information from 100,000 taxpayers? Can you talk to us about the security in place and how that was breached?\n\nNIGAM: Well, it's really interesting, Maria, because the IRS is guarding some of the most sensitive information, and yet their security protocols were not designed to protect that information.\n\nSo for example, they didn't have what appears to be what I would call triggers for anomalous behavior. In other words, if somebody in Russia in an IP address that comes out of Russia is coming into your system and asking for an account that belongs in, say, Pennsylvania, that should immediately alert a trigger that says take a look, why is this Pennsylvania resident all the sudden in Russia asking for their taxpayer file?\n\nSo, that's one basic failure in the system that I can see right away.\n\nBARTIROMO: What should the IRS be doing in terms of its system and protecting it? And what can people at home do in terms of having a comfort feeling that their information is secure?\n\nNIGAM: Well, one thing the IRS can do is do what's called -- and this is basic security -- it's called something you have and something you know. If I'm a citizen asking for my information and let's say it's a hacker in my place stealing my identity, they might know all my security information, which is exactly what these hackers did, but they don't have my phone number at home, my land line. They don't have my cell phone. So the IRS could basically, or very simply trigger a phone call to me that says, are you right now trying to get on and get your information?\n\nSomething I have, I have my cell phone. A hacker doesn't have that. That would have prevented many of these requests.\n\nAnd it also would have said to the IRS, something is going on, better take a look. So if you're watching at home, think about this, put a credit lock on your credit now, even if you think you had your e-mail password stolen somewhere else. Go to the IRS website. I know this is not something we want to do right now, but go to the IRS website and fill out that form that says you may have been a victim of identity theft, even if it was somewhere else.\n\nAnd then more important than anything else, use the latest anti-virus, anti-phishing software and keep it updated, do not hit that remind me later button, that is what gets you in trouble.\n\nBARTIROMO: The remind me later button gets you in trouble. Why, because you're not cleaning things up right away?\n\nNIGAM: Well, if you're doing a security update when it comes on, what happens is you're telling the hackers out there there's a security hole, there's a fix for it, I just decided I'm not going to do anything about it right now. And it's so easy for us to do that.\n\nWere you surprised that we're learning now that the breach or the hack originated in Russia?\n\nNIGAM: Well, that's what it appears to be. What hackers often do is they jump from place to place. They may want to pretend they're in Russia. As far as we know, they could be sitting in China, they could be sitting in London. We don't know. But it's something that appears to be true.\n\nNot really, because hackers do that a lot. But what I am more surprised about is how could an IP address or a hacker coming in from Russia asking for American citizen trust -- tax information not be triggered by the IRS? That says something unusual, something funny is going on here, let me take a look. That's what I am surprised by.\n\nBARTIROMO: It is quite extraordinary. Hemu, good to have you on the program. Thanks very much for weighing in.\n\nBARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, Hemu Nigam, joining us there.\n\nWisconsin governor Scott Walker topping some polls in the race to the White House. When will he make his campaign official?\n\nI'll talk with him next as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Wisconsin governor Scott Walker topping a new poll among Republican voters in Iowa, the site of the first 2016 presidential caucus. Walker gained 17 percent of the vote in a Des Moines Register poll, followed Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Dr. Ben Carson.\n\nI spoke with Governor Walker to learn when he will announce that run.\n\nBARTIROMO: Governor, thanks for joining us.\n\nGOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS.: Thanks for having me on.\n\nBARTIROMO: You have been traveling throughout the country. Back in January you filed what's called a 527. You launched a website. And your 527 was -- is called The American Revival. But you've yet to throw your hat officially in the ring for the presidential election.\n\nWhat's taking you so long?\n\nWhy haven't you announced yet?\n\nWALKER: Yes. Well, as governor of Wisconsin, at least in our state, our budget comes out every two years. State budget will be done at the end of June. It's still my obligation to see through a positive budget that hopefully for the fifth and sixth year in a row will actually lower property taxes in our state even from where they were before I took office in 2010.\n\nBut I want to have a good budget that continues to provide reform in our state. Shortly after, we'll be announcing our intentions to the people of this great country.\n\nBARTIROMO: So that's in the next month.\n\nBARTIROMO: This past week we got another dismal GDP number. The first quarter, in fact, actually contracted. It was negative. We've got the jobs number coming out this upcoming Friday.\n\nHow do you move the needle on growth and jobs in America?\n\nWALKER: Well, I think you need to act quickly. I think the next president can't just be -- it's not enough just to have a Republican. Hopefully we have a Republican House should be sustained. Hopefully we'll have a Republican United States Senate. But it's not enough just to have Republicans in charge.\n\nYou need to have someone who's ready to reform on day one, something we did four years ago. We took on the reforms right away, I think in the first 45 to 100 days.\n\nWe have to push a big, bold, aggressive agenda when it comes to growth there. It's not just about austerity but really about growth, about understanding the people of this country create jobs, not the government.\n\nThis president and people like Hillary Clinton, they tend to think you grow the economy by growing Washington. Last year six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C. I think we ought to grow the county and cities and towns and villages all across the U.S.\n\nThe way to do it is lower tax burden, lower marginal tax rates, make American employers job creators competitive again with a rate that's competitive around the world so that more American jobs can come back from overseas.\n\nRepeal ObamaCare and put patients back in charge again. Dramatically rein in regulations, sending many of those responsibilities back to the states and ultimately to the people.\n\nUsing the abundance of all the energy supplies we have here in this country and on this continent and having a level playing field when it comes to trade globally. I think all of those things could get us from the very stagnant growth we've been seeing in the last few months to a growth pattern I think is realistic to get us to 4 percent, almost 4.5 percent growth.\n\nBARTIROMO: All right. Let me move on to foreign policy because this is an area where your skeptics out there will say you're not up to the job in terms of foreign policy, in terms of your knowledge, your leadership, when it comes to some of these big issues out there.\n\nI'll start with the question of the day that everyone is asking and that is the Iraq war.\n\nIf you knew what you know today, would you have gone in to Iraq the way President Bush did?\n\nWALKER: Well, just one thing, a qualifier to begin with. I'd point out that in the overall issue of foreign policy, I'd say in my lifetime, the most impressive president when it came to foreign policy was a governor from California.\n\nIn my lifetime, the worst president of foreign policy was a freshman senator from Illinois.\n\nSo being a senator or a governor isn't as important as leadership. In this case, when it comes to leadership, I'll just flat out tell you, I think that any president, regardless of party, would have made a similar decision to what the president did at the time with the information that was available.\n\nHillary Clinton, a member the United States Senate at the time, voted for an authorizing resolution because she and other members of both parties had the same levels or the same type of information that President Bush had at the time.\n\nSo I can't fault them for that decision, knowing what they thought they knew at the time.\n\nWhere I do think he deserves credit is a few years later when the surge took place, I think that was the right move and got us on the right track. I think the ultimate important question today is to ask people like Hillary Clinton and President Obama, why, when you knew years ago the same thing you know today, and that is that there are serious military concerns about leaving Iraq too soon, particularly after we had achieved victory and had we had peace sustained there in the region, why did they pull out?\n\nBARTIROMO: Why are we having these discussions?\n\nWhat should be done in terms of the potential of a deal with Iran?\n\nWALKER: On day one, January 20th, 2017, I'd pull back from that faulty deal. I think it's a big error. I'd be willing to negotiate with Iran, but on our terms, not on their terms.\n\nTo me it's real simple. Our terms would be you need to dismantle your illicit nuclear infrastructure.\n\nSecondly, you need to disclose fully and provide full transparency including immediate ability to inspect, particularly at their underground fortified facilities.\n\nThen they need to deal with others in the region. That means recognizing that Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state. And that they're going to pull out of what you alluded to, I mean, Iran has got their hands involved, whether it's with the Houthis in Yemen or what we see in Syria or elsewhere around the world in terrorist or terrorist-related activities. They need to get out of that.\n\nAnd they need to get rid of the intercontinental ballistic missiles, not only those targeted at Israel, but those potentially targeted at the United States.\n\nThose are the terms of our deal. If they don't, we need to pull back on that deal, put sanctions back in place from America and encourage our allies around the world to do the same.\n\nBARTIROMO: I feel like in some corners of the country, people are feeling like the GOP or the extreme right of the GOP does not understand how America has changed. You've talked about how you've gone to a friend's gay reception but you didn't go to the wedding.\n\nDo you think that the GOP in general or certainly all the way to the Right are missing how America has changed and what America feels about as far as their freedoms?\n\nDo you think America has changed in the last 10 years?\n\nWALKER: I still believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. I voted for that and the legislature for it in the constitution, defend it in our state. As you mentioned, I had a family member on my wife's side, one of our great cousins that we love, and we went there even though we have a belief of what legally constitutes marriage, we were there because we love her. We love her and we love the whole family. And so of course we're going to be there.\n\nIn terms of this issue, though, it's one of those where it's interesting. Going forward, the next president is going to have very limited impact on this. If the courts rule in the coming days, they're going to rule one of two ways, they're either going to say either that marriage amongst -- marriage is defined as something the state should be doing, or they're going to say that marriage amongst same-sex couples is legal. The only other alternative to that is a constitutional amendment, which is something that doesn't go through the legislative process, it's something the states and congress has to act on.\n\nSo, it's really not going to be an issue in the next presidential election.\n\nBut I don't shy away -- I think even if people disagree with me, even if some people have changed in that regard, people deserve to know what my opinion is on that, the same way I'm pro-life.\n\nBut I think in the end, what they want to know is what are you going to do to lead America forward, not to pit one group of Americans versus another. And I think we have got a pretty good story to tell.\n\nBARTIROMO: Governor, good to have you on the show today.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Governor Scott Walker.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate meeting today in a special session in a last-ditch effort to maintain the counterterrorism powers of the Patriot Act. Now, the White House warning there is no plan B to keep the programs running without new legislation. Our panel begins right there as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" We'll be right back.\n\nAnd we add our condolences to the Biden family after that tragedy of his son. We want to bring in our panel. Ed Rollins is the former principal White House adviser to President Reagan. He has been a long-time strategist to business and political leaders. He's a Fox news political analyst.\n\nMary Kissel is a Wall Street Journal editorial board member.\n\nAnd Hank Sheinkopf is the president of Sheinkopf limited, a Democratic strategist, who also worked on the Clinton/Gore campaign.\n\nGood to see everybody. Thanks very much for joining us.\n\nAnd of course we knew that Beau Biden was sick, but I don't know that there was such expectations that he would pass at 46, Ed.\n\nED ROLLINS, FRM. REAGAN ADVISER: It's very unfortunate. He's a fine young man. He was a two-term governor -- two-term attorney general. He was going to run for governor in the future. He certainly would have had a great career in politics if this tragedy hadn't occurred.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the Biden family has had a series of disasters like this. I certainly disagree with his politics, but I certainly admire him as a man and send my condolences to his son.\n\nMARY KISSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Thoughts and prayers are with his family, Maria.\n\nHANK SHEINKOPF, PRESIDENT SHEINKOPF LIMITED: A tragedy by any measure. 46. No words can describe it.\n\nBARTIROMO: 46 years old, brain cancer. Really, so sad. We send our thoughts this morning.\n\nWith the PATRIOT Act, meanwhile, set to expire at midnight tonight, the senate will hold a rare Sunday session today in a last-ditch effort to replace or extend a number of anti-terror programs, including the NSA's controversial collection of Americans' phone records.\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul vowing to block any vote to extend the legislation despite warnings from the White House that letting it die would put Americans at risk.\n\nYour thoughts this morning on the Patriot Act, Mary?\n\nKISSEL: I think this is a reckless, reckless posturing at a time of rising global disorder. Let's remember that the Patriot Act was put in place after 9/11 to ensure that we never had another 9/11, and we have a former CIA director that said the metadata collection program would have prevented it had it been in place.\n\nI think Senator Paul postulates a lot of hypothetical impingements on our liberties, but would Senator Paul like to take responsibility if we have another 9/11? He's put the House in a very, very difficult position and also politically, Maria, it allows the White House to say to the GOP, well, if there's another terror attack, it's your fault, never mind that the president has stopped interrogations, that he sent GITMO prisoners back, and the rest.\n\nThis is a terrible day for America. And I think it puts us at a lot of risk.\n\nBARTIROMO: Ed, do you agree with that?\n\nROLLINS: I disagree a little bit. Another 9/11 is not going to occur because we don't have the Patriot Act. I mean, we have very due diligence, our guard is up. I think if this bill is getting killed today, I think Paul is going to kill it. But I think there will be some compromise that'll come forth this week, you know, another variant of the House, or something like that.\n\nA lot of the provisions that we think are important are going to be re- evaluated and reimplemented.\n\nThis is really Snowden's greatest reward. This was he who brought this all to the attention of the American public. And there's a lot of Americans who didn't like having their phones listened to, what have you. And I think Paul's arguments, that we can all still with warrants, go to courts, live by the constitution, I think a lot of people adhere to that.\n\nSHEINKOPF: Raw, gut politics, big loser here, Mitch McConnell. He doesn't look like he's in charge of his own chamber. He looks like he's not able to get things done, Republicans running around on different parts of the spectrum, Rand Paul making him look foolish. And the other guy who's hoping this doesn't work out is Boehner. He doesn't want to deal with this in his chamber. He may be the lucky guy.\n\nKISSEL: Yeah, let's be -- let's be clear for everyone listening. The NSA is not listening to your phone calls. They're looking at call records and who's calling whom. So the way that Senator Paul and others have characterized this program is absolutely inaccurate. The Supreme Court has said, since the 1970s, you don't need a warrant to look at this stuff. You've got to blame the president here for not explaining to the American public what the NSA program was all about and why we needed it.\n\nSHEINKOPF: Nancy is right about one thing. The big winner here is Barack Obama. He's on the television. He's giving sound bites to people, saying, \"Look, these guys can't get it together. I want to protect America.\" And he looks like the man who's trying to put this together to protect American citizens.\n\nROLLINS: Well, Hank, no offense, you're a long-time friend, but, I mean, if anybody is going to think Barack Obama is protecting America when the weakness of his administration has created chaos throughout the world, I think...\n\nSHEINKOPF: On this issue, he looks like he's doing the best he can and the right thing for the country.\n\nROLLINS: Well, the best -- I think he tries to do the best he can every day, but it's just not good enough, and there's going to be a whole campaign about that in the very near future.\n\nBARTIROMO: You make a point, though, in terms of what it shows about the Republicans, though, constantly arguing -- and the granularity of every subject, in terms of, you know, the divisions.\n\nROLLINS: Well, there's three divisions, and they're very significant. I think the point that Hank made about Mitch McConnell -- here's the senior senator, majority leader from Kentucky. This is the junior senator from Kentucky that's leading the charge against him. It's all about presidential politics. Paul is one of the leaders of the Tea Party. It's an important element. The (inaudible) agenda is part of our -- our coalition and the old business establishment Republican. We have three elements of our party that are all basically at -- at war with each other...\n\nKISSEL: And we're going to give the victory to Edward Snowden. Remember that those revelations came out in 2013. Well, since then, what have we had? We've had the rise of ISIS. This is a period where the world is a far more dangerous place, where we need our intelligence agencies to have the ability to connect dots.\n\nWhat we're doing is we're taking away the dots from the NSA. This is a terrible day for America. We need these programs, and we need the White House to explain why we need these programs.\n\nBARTIROMO: Yeah, it certainly is a much different world today than even just 2013.\n\nTake a short break. The 2016 field expanding on both sides of the aisle. Our panel will take a look at the latest former politicians looking to get back into the political fray, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Top of the hour is \"MediaBuzz.\" Let's check in with Howard Kurtz, see what's going on, on his program.\n\nGood morning to you, Howie.\n\nHOWARD KURTZ, HOST, \"MEDIABUZZ\": Hello, Maria. We're going to look at the stunning indictment and the coverage of -- against -- these charges against former House Speaker Denny Hastert, look at some of the presidential candidates who got into the race this week on both sides, how they're getting very little coverage, maybe the media just, kind of, prematurely writing them off.\n\nAnd as he steps down after a half a century at CBS, final conversation with Bob Schieffer.\n\nBARTIROMO: All right. We'll see you in about 10 minutes, Howie. We will be there. And as you just mentioned, Hillary Clinton has a new challenger, and the Republican field expanded last week. Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley taking the plunge for the Democrats, throwing his hat in the ring for president yesterday. Former New York Governor George Pataki and the man who came in second behind Mitt Romney last time around, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, also making their bids for the GOP.\n\nYour thoughts on the new field, Ed Rollins?\n\nROLLINS: They had their highlight this week. Santorum, who was the runner- up last time because he was a conservative alternative, will be crowded out by other conservatives who are new faces this time. Pataki's going absolutely nowhere. He'll be one of the first ones out of the race. And I think that O'Malley would be a legitimate candidate in another year, but this isn't another year for the Democrats. Hillary is going to take this thing and take it pretty easy.\n\nBARTIROMO: Will the Dems support Martin O'Malley, Hank?\n\nSHEINKOPF: Not likely. They'll probably try to get rid of him quickly because the Clintons will not want him there and they'll try to -- they've been not successful doing that with Bernie Sanders, but, you know, they just don't want any competition, to spend money they don't have spend.\n\nKISSEL: You know, two of these candidates say interesting things about their respective parties. Rick Santorum is running as a right-wing populist, had some anti-immigration notes there. I think that's interesting and worrying about what it says about the GOP, the focus on growth.\n\nIn terms of O'Malley, he's basically running the campaign that Senator Elizabeth Warren was running. He's running an anti-bank, populist campaign on the far, far left of the party.\n\nBARTIROMO: He says Wall Street needs to be reined in even further.\n\nKISSEL: Right. Well, essentially, he's running to the party that President Obama wanted to create. Obama has pulled the party way far to the left. That is not who Hillary Clinton is. It's who she's trying to be because she senses that. So, to my mind, that was what was interesting about the announcements this week.\n\nBARTIROMO: What's going on behind the scenes, Hank, between the president -- President Obama and Hillary -- and the Hillary camp? Is he working against her?\n\nSHEINKOPF: I've always believed that he is not a great fan. And I've always believed that he is doing whatever he can to block her. And I wouldn't be surprised if Obama operatives show up in the O'Malley operation in some fashion.\n\nBut it's too late. She's got that dough. She's got the speed. She's got the institutional players. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden would have been the institutional guy, but he's not going to be there. She's the one. And the -- she can only -- she'll get elected if the Republicans don't have a real horse to knock her off.\n\nROLLINS: Or she defeats herself.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is, there is no Obama campaign left. Unlike when Bush won the third term of Reagan, there was a campaign in place that he was able to pick up and run with. The Obama people have deliberately not put it into the DNC, not handed it off to her. Some of the operatives have gone on to set up a contract.\n\nShe has to re-create her own campaign, her own campaign mechanism, which she will do, but it will take more time and more money.\n\nKISSEL: There's no love lost because they don't like what the Clintons were in the '90s and what they represented. So Obama/Clinton, you could characterize them as \"frenemies.\"\n\nObama also did nothing to cultivate younger talent within the party. And so I think, you know, again, when you saw O'Malley's announcement, that's a lot of excitement among the Democratic base and the progressives in the party because it is a progressive party today. They have pushed out every moderate that was left in the Democratic Party.\n\nROLLINS: He also made a very deliberate choice not to pick someone that could succeed him as his vice president, and certainly not to cast any aspersions on Joe Biden, but Joe Biden was too old, couldn't basically become a viable candidate.\n\nWe did the same thing when we nominated Sarah Palin. There was no -- there was no \"there\" there in the future. So my sense is she now has control of the party and the mechanism and she's going to be very hard to beat in the Democratic side.\n\nBARTIROMO: On the Democratic side. I want to talk about the general election next. We'll take a short break. A revised GDP number weighed down on Wall Street at the end of the week. We'll take a look at the first- quarter fallout, what it means for the recovery and the election, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Back in a minute.\n\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back with our panel, Ed, Mary, Hank.\n\nI want to get back to this issue of the Obama administration, Hank, working against Hillary. What do you know?\n\nSHEINKOPF: Well, look, it's simple. They don't -- it's clear to see that the Obama people do not want the Clintons in charge of that Democratic Party apparatus again. Because, if they are, there won't be an Obama legacy. And that bad blood continues to boil.\n\nBARTIROMO: So Hillary will likely get the nomination in her party, Ed, but what about the general election? A Florida judge setting a date for a racketeering charge against the Clintons?\n\nROLLINS: This is very serious. This came out on Friday. The language is all bad. I don't know what the details of it are, but the basic thing, look at the fund-raising that's gone on in the Clinton Foundation. One of the arguments is that they need to have a special envoy to take charge of all the -- there's just a whole variety of things that can happen. And this was supposed to set for trial in January.\n\nSo it's a bad time for them. A lot can happen outside of court, but when you say the word \"RICO,\" you think of the Mafia; you think of -- and it is about racketeering, criminal things, and the charges that they used this to get money from foreign clients and what have you while she was secretary of state, and it was a quid pro quo. And that's not going to be very pretty when the court has...\n\nBARTIROMO: And of course the courts have ruled that we will get to see Hillary Clinton's e-mails every month, every 60 days. That has to mean that there's going to be constant scrutiny about what's in those e-mails.\n\nKISSEL: You mean the e-mails that she didn't delete, Maria?\n\nBARTIROMO: The ones she did not delete.\n\nKISSEL: Well, it's extraordinary that she continues as a candidate, given all the scandals that have come out. It's a testimony to the tenacity of Hillary. I mean, she's just clawing on there. If you think about what we've already learned, without knowing what's in those e-mails...\n\nBARTIROMO: And without her answering any questions.\n\nKISSEL: Answering any questions. I mean, we know that she was taking informal intelligence from Sidney Blumenthal, who was at the same time employed by the Clinton Foundation and trying to start a business in Libya at the same time he was advising the secretary.\n\nThere's the private e-mail server that she did not disclose. We have the Clinton Foundation and all of those links to foreign governments. We've got Bill's speaking fees and the potential quid pro quo there.\n\nI mean, just pick one. You know, when she does have to start answering questions from the press, it's going to be very interesting.\n\nROLLINS: She's still the nominee, though.\n\nSHEINKOPF: The punditry and the press corps will think about this in big pieces. In order to make the public get it, it has to be in small bites. Small bites are \"What did you get,\" \"When did you get it.\" And the person who's going to figure this out for whomever on the Web is going to be the most important person in this political season.\n\nBARTIROMO: Let's take a quick break and then get the one thing to watch for the week ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" from our panel. Stay with us.\n\nBARTIROMO: And we're back with our panel with the one thing to watch for the upcoming week. Mary Kissel, what are you watching?\n\nKISSEL: I'm watching the Export-Import Bank fight in Congress. This is the crony-est taxpayer-backed bank. Congress has to do exactly nothing to let its charter expire. They should. It's a test of the GOP and the direction that the party wants to take. Are they going to be the party of free markets or are they going to be the party of the Chamber of Commerce, the Fortune 500 and of crony-ism?\n\nROLLINS: I'm going to watch Governor Walker. You had a great interview with him, and people saw a lot of the appeal that he has. He's a guy who's moved to the forefront. He, for all practical purposes, is the front- runner. Can he stay there? Can he maintain it? And his budget, as you talked about -- it's very, very important to get a balanced budget.\n\nSHEINKOPF: It's the Patriot Act; it's Mitch McConnell falling apart, simple.\n\nBARTIROMO: All right. We will be watching all of that. Thanks very much. Thank you to our panel.\n\nThat'll do it for \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. I'll be back tomorrow morning for the premiere of my new morning show. \"Mornings With Maria\" kicks off tomorrow at 6 a.m. Eastern on the Fox Business Network. We've got three big guests tomorrow.

Working from a dingy office building just a short drive from the glittering Mediterranean Sea, eight immigrants from Europe formed an unlikely team that allegedly conspired to dupe major multinational companies out of millions of dollars.\n\nMost of them spoke French, the others Italian. Using their language skills and familiarity with European business practices, they telephoned employees at some of Europe\u2019s biggest companies, identified themselves as top executives and tricked workers into transferring large sums of money to bank accounts in their control, police said. Among the companies targeted, according to police and suspects\u2019 lawyers: Kia Motors, Hugo Boss, and Chanel.\n\nIt was a classic \u2018\u2018fake CEO\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018fake president\u2019\u2019 scam, a scheme used by various criminals worldwide that has robbed companies of some $1.8 billion in just over two years, according to the FBI. Most of the eight suspects in the latest case are either jailed or under house arrest.\n\nBut not the man who boasts of pioneering the scam years ago, inspiring copycats like these around the globe: French-Israeli con artist Gilbert Chikli. He mysteriously remains a free man, living in luxury in his villa in a seaside Israeli city as French authorities try to bring him to justice over a massive con for which he was previously convicted.\n\n\u2018\u2018If they have a problem, they can come see me. They know my address. I am not fleeing,\u2019\u2019 Chikli said by telephone. \u2018\u2018Send them my regards.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe case illustrates how financial crime has globalized faster and more efficiently than the law enforcement that is trying to fight it.\n\nIsrael extradited Chikli to France to stand trial in 2008 for defrauding HSBC, Thomson, Accenture, and other companies out of 6.1 million euros ($6.9 million), and attempting to extract more than 70 million euros ($79.5 million) from at least 33 others. But in 2009, Chikli says he chartered a private plane and flew back to Israel.\n\nA French court in May 2015 sentenced him in absentia to seven years in prison. Instead, he\u2019s been sipping coffee at a portside caf\u00e9 in Israel and hanging out at his private swimming pool.\n\nFrance issued two requests to Israel for Chikli\u2019s arrest, the French Justice Ministry said. The first request came the year after he escaped prosecution in France.\n\nThe second came this January, according to a copy of the Interpol notice. It was issued just two weeks after the release of a new heist-thriller film based on Chikli\u2019s life story, starring Julie Gayet, the companion of French President Francois Hollande. Chikli\u2019s wife, Shirly, attended the Paris premiere.\n\nStill, Israeli officials show no signs of going after Chikli, even as they prosecute his alleged copycats for similar crimes. Israel\u2019s police and Justice Ministry declined to explain why, saying they do not discuss individual cases.\n\nFrance\u2019s Justice Ministry said the Interpol notice issued against Chikli, called a \u2018\u2018diffusion,\u2019\u2019 is the equivalent of a provisional arrest warrant, with an aim to extradite a criminal to France. Interpol cannot force a country to comply with arrest notices and some countries routinely ignore them. Israeli Justice Ministry spokesman Noam Sharvit said Israel adheres to extradition requests when warranted.\n\nFrench Justice Ministry spokesman Olivier Pedro-Jose said Israeli-French cooperation on such cases comes with delays. \u2018\u2018The execution of requests for help from French officials by their Israeli counterparts often relate to extremely complex financial affairs, which demand long and considerable investigations,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIrit Kohn, a former director of the Israeli Justice Ministry\u2019s international department, said the countries\u2019 differing legal systems have held up cooperation on criminal cases.\n\nCriminals, in contrast, have been far more nimble at running their cross-border activities, keeping a step ahead of the law.\n\nIn the case of the eight immigrants in Israel, police began tracking them in November, secretly videotaping them from inside their office in an old building housing a car-repair shop in Netanya, a Mediterranean city north of Tel Aviv that is home to a large French immigrant community.\n\nOn May 2, police raided the suspects\u2019 office.

And he added that he\u2019s no longer sure if the bag ever contained evidence from the investigation.\n\n\u201cI can only say that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not true,\u201d Eoannou said during a hastily called news conference at his downtown Buffalo law office. \u201cI received the story line from the mother. And it\u2019s my position that I\u2019m not comfortable with that version of the events.\u201d\n\nDespite his concerns, Eoannou said he\u2019s still confident in the woman\u2019s allegations against Kane.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that reflects, and I don\u2019t think it does, on the night in question,\u201d Eoannou said.\n\nThe woman\u2019s mother did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment from the Associated Press. The AP does not identify people who may have been sexually assaulted unless they have come forward and voluntarily identified themselves.\n\nErie County district attorney Frank Sedita, reached at home after the news conference, declined comment but said he would address the issue Friday at a previously scheduled news conference.\n\nThe reversal comes after police said Wednesday that the rape kit and its packaging were handled properly, and after Eoannou held a press conference to announce the evidence bag was found by the women\u2019s mother at the front door of her home.\n\nKane has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in her 20s at his waterfront mansion outside of Buffalo on 2 August. He has not been charged.\n\nLast week, Kane said he did nothing wrong and expected to be absolved.\n\nEoannou\u2019s reversal and decision to withdraw as counsel is the latest twist in a case that has been a source of intense speculation and rumor since Hamburg police first announced they had launched an investigation against Kane.\n\nOn Wednesday, Eoannou held a news conference in the same law office boardroom where he displayed the evidence bag which he had confirmed to be authentic. He said the paper bag was labeled with personal identifying information for the woman, details on where the rape kit was used and the initials of the nurses who administered the kit.\n\nHe began having reservations of the mother\u2019s version of events after continuing his own investigation into how the bag was found, and after meeting with prosecutors on Thursday.\n\nEoannou wouldn\u2019t reveal what specific concerns he had with the mother\u2019s story. He would only say, \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with that version of events.\u201d\n\nKane\u2019s attorney, Paul Cambria, held his own news conference later Thursday night by reiterating he believes that Kane is being victimized.\n\n\u201cPeople keep using the word victim, victim, and in my opinion, you don\u2019t know who the victim is until all the facts are in,\u201d Cambria said.\n\n\u201cThis happening today is bizarre,\u201d Cambria said, noting that officials had confirmed all the evidence had been accounted for. \u201cToday, within 24 hours of these kind of astronomical claims yesterday, we now find out that they\u2019re false.\u201d\n\nKane and the NHL have been subject to criticism for allowing the player to report to training camp and play in the preseason despite the investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said \u201cnothing\u2019s changed,\u201d regarding Kane\u2019s status with the team. He shrugged off the notion that the latest news involving Kane contributes to a distraction.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t change our routine at all,\u201d Quenneville told reporters outside his team\u2019s dressing room in Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual, going into the game.\u201d\n\nThe Blackhawks, who have won three Stanley Cups in six years, open the regular season 7 October at home against the New York Rangers.", "summary": "Attorney for accuser in the rape investigation of Chicago Blackhawks star withdraws from case", "density": 1.4285714286, "coverage": 0.8571428571, "compression": 55.9285714286, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2010/09/28/DI2010092804903.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2010100119id_/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2010/09/28/DI2010092804903.html", "title": "Snyder v.

Phelps will be argued Oct. 6 at the Supreme Court.\n\nIt was initiated by Albert Snyder against members of the Westboro Baptist Church, known for promoting their anti-gay messages. Fundamentalist pastor Fred Phelps and his followers picketed at the funeral of his son, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in action while serving in Iraq.\n\nChurch's protests at military funerals a free-speech test for Supreme Court (Post, Sept. 30)\n\n\"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear this case in order to address various free speech issues. The VFW filed its amicus curiae brief in order to carry out its congressional mandate \"to preserve and strengthen comradeship among its members; to assist worthy comrades; to perpetuate the memory and history of our dead, and to assist their widows and orphans,\" said Timothy Nieman, attorney and counsel of record for the VFW in the Snyder case.\n\nNieman was online Friday, Oct. 1, at Noon ET to discuss the case for Albert Snyder.\n\nProgramming Note: For the Fred W. Phelps side of the case, read\n\nSnyder v. Phelps: Case of protesting anti-gay messages outside a funeral reaches Supreme Court.\n\nTimothy Nieman: Good afternoon, my name is Tim Nieman and I am an attorney at Rhoads & Sinon in Harrisburg, PA. I represent the VFW in the Snyder v Phelps case, which is scheduled for argument before the Supreme Court on Wednesday. I look forward to your questions concerning this most interesting and important case.\n\nWashington, D.C.: I think Phelps and his followers are sick people, and their message is disgusting. However, I have a problem with the idea that their actions should be criminalized. How can using the state to punish them for what is admittedly hateful speech be constitutional in line with Supreme Court precedent?\n\nTimothy Nieman: It is universally agreed that the Phelps' speech is cruel and insensitive. However, this is not a case of the government criminalizing speech. Rather, Mr. Snyder filed a civil lawsuit seeking damages for the pain that he suffered as a result of targeted attack of the protesters. We must remember that Mr. Snyder was a private citizen who only asked to peacefully mourn his son. This is not a case of state punishment.\n\nEast Liverpool, Ohio: Has Mr. Phelps been questioned or has he offered a comment regarding his feelings should a gay organization protest at a Phelps family funeral, the funeral of any family belonging to the Westboro Baptist church or during any such church service?\n\nTimothy Nieman: I am unaware of Mr. Phelps' opinion on this topic. However, I would suspect that he would find it equally distressing. You only have one opportunity to mourn and bury your loved ones. To have that sacred time interrupted by hateful protests is emotionally distressing to say the least.\n\nRichmond, Va.: Religious freedom does not give me the right to threaten and intimidate others. I and the Phelps clan are free to worship the religion of our respective choices IN OUR HOMES and IN OUR CHURCHES. The Constitution does not allow us to force our religious views on others.\n\nTimothy Nieman: The Constitution does not allow someone to force their religious views on others. We need to remember that the Snyder family was also engaging in a religious expression by trying to peacefully bury their son.\n\nCarytown, Richmond, Va.: What can I do to help honor those fallen soldiers and their families? They died to protect my freedom and if there were anything I could do to thank them for their service and keep the funerals respectful, I'd do it. If I could wrestle Phelps to the ground, I'd do it by golly.\n\nTimothy Nieman: I think that even people who believe that Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church have a right to protest agree with your sentiment about wanting to wrestle them to the ground.\n\nAustin, Tex.: Could you explain, as best you understand it, what is the rationale of these Westboro people?\n\nClearly, any decent human being would conclude that military funerals are no place to hold a political protest about anything. But in the case, for instance, of a radical antiwar group protesting at funerals, one could sort of see the logic, however offensive the act might be.\n\nBut gays? The last I heard, the military wasn't the most gay-friendly environment anyway.\n\nTimothy Nieman: Clearly they were thinking (and rightfully so) that they can get maximum media exposure by protesting at military funerals. By virtue of the fact that we are talking about this today proves this point. I agree with your sentiments. Matthew Snyder was a private citizen who laid down his life in defense of the United States. His father was a private citizen who had no ability to change the military's policy on don't ask, don't tell. Yet, this group targeted him at the most vulnerable time of his life.\n\nSouthern Maryland: First Amendment issues aside, Phelps and his followers are causing much heartache for the families of fallen soldiers. I had hoped that they would go away if the media became disinterested, since they seem to crave attention. Hypothetically speaking, if funeral homes or churches arranged for private security guards to keep the Phelps group away from the funerals, would they be on solid legal ground?\n\nTimothy Nieman: Yes, funeral homes could bar protesters from their own private property. The problem arises when the protesters are on public property adjacent to the funeral home, such as a sidewalk or street. That is really what this case is about. The Supreme Court has developed what is known as the captive audience doctrine, which protects private citizens from intrusive speech. For example, the Court has ruled that picketers can be barred from protesting outside a private residence on the theory that you are \"captive\" in your home and cannot avoid the speech because there is no further place of refuge. The same goes for hospitals. Here, in order to mourn the loss of his son, Mr. Snyder had to attend the funeral service. He was a captive audience and, in my opinion, the Court should find in Mr. Snyder's favor on this basis.\n\nRichmond, Va.: Please thank the Snyders for their son's service to our nation. He died protecting my freedom.\n\nTimothy Nieman: Thank you and I will pass on your condolences. We are all proud of Matthew's service and sacrifice.\n\nVan Ness, D.C.: Who is defending Westboro? And who is paying those legal bills? Has the ACLU taken a position on this matter?\n\nTimothy Nieman: Westboro is represented by one of Mr. Phelps' daughters. The ACLU has filed a brief in support of Westboro, as have a number of other organizations. In addition to the VFW (who I represent), a number of other organizations and government officials have filed briefs in support of the Snyders.\n\nWashington, D.C.: There used to be a group organized by a friend of Matthew Shepard that would stand in a row between the Phelpses and the funeral wearing giant angel wings to effectively block the visual spectacle of the Phelpes from those attending the funeral. Is this group still active?\n\nTimothy Nieman: I am not sure if the group that you refer to is still active. However, there is a group of veterans who do counter-protest in these situations.\n\nFairfax, Va.: Mr. Nieman --\n\nThe Supreme Court rulings in this area seem to have consistently included the implicit idea that no one is forced to endure protected scurrilous protests, i.e., if you don't like to see Nazis march in Skokie, don't go to watch their parade. In this instance though, staying away or otherwise not participating is not an option. Additionally it appears that constitutionally sanctioned limits may be placed on the times and places of picketing, demonstrating, etc. Do you think this can apply here, or will freedom of religion ultimately trump everything?\n\nTimothy Nieman: I agree with your sentiment. As I mentioned above, a mourning family member who attends the private funeral of a loved one is captive and cannot avoid the speech. In my opinion the Supreme Court should apply the captive audience doctrine to funeral protests.\n\nWe can't yell FIRE in a crowded theater: And we should not be able to disturb a private funeral. That in NO way limits my freedom of speech nor my freedom of religion. It protects those mourning families' privacy.\n\nTimothy Nieman: There are a number of limits on what and how we can speak or express our views. These is a perfect example of just such a case.\n\nD.C.: I'm supportive of Phelp's right to free speech, but I'm not entirely convinced this is a free speech issue. Wasn't the lawsuit a civil one? It seems to me that free speech would deal with criminal law, and would imply government action.\n\nFree speech isn't consequence-free. Civil damages seem a reasonable consequence of such vile speech during such an emotionally sensitive time.\n\nMy condolences to the Snyder family.\n\nTimothy Nieman: Yes, this was a civil lawsuit, however there is a free speech component to the case. Phelps argues that civil damages can chill speech. However, throughout our history parties injured by speech have successfully brought lawsuits to vindicate their reputations and recover damages for their injuries and suffering.\n\nNE Ohio: Can you discuss the nature and or amount of damage sought by Mr. Snyder?\n\nTimothy Nieman: The jury awarded Mr. Snyder $2.9 million in damages and $8 million in punitive damages for his emotional distress and the invasion of his privacy. The court then reduced the verdict to $5.1 million. When the appeals court overturned the verdict, it unfortunately ordered Mr. Snyder to pay Phelps' attorneys fees.\n\n1st Amendment: As loathsome as the Westboro Baptist church is, aren't they within their first amendment rights? Those same rights that soldiers are fighting for? Is there any argument that, while they have the right to protest, their actual message constitutes hate speech against gays and is thereby unprotected?\n\nTimothy Nieman: The hate speech angle of this case is not before the Court. And yes, Matthew Snyder and all our soldiers are fighting to protect our rights, including the right of free speech. However, as George Washington cautioned, \"The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by this Country.\"\n\nWashington, D.C.: Generally I'm not a fan of lawyers, but I commend you on your hard work on a difficult case. All soldiers, gay, straight, black, white, men, women, are heroes, as are their families who support them. I can think of few people who deserve our respect more than the grieving family of a fallen soldier, and I can think of few people who I despise as much as those that look to capitalize on such an event. Keep up the good fight.\n\nTimothy Nieman: Thank you, however, the real thanks goes to the men and women who have and continue to serve in our armed forces.\n\nMaryland: Could there not be a case for libel. WBC waves signs saying \"God Hates Fags.\" Anybody passing would take the implication that the deceased was gay, which apparently is not the case.\n\nTimothy Nieman: A defamation claim was included in the original claim. The trial court did not allow that claim to go forward because there was no loss of reputation.\n\nSanta Barbara, Calif.: Mr. Nieman,\n\nForgive me for saying this, but your case seems to hinge on what is considered decent and moral, not necessarily what is legal and protected under the Constitution. Your last quote about Washington just seems to reinforce this impression.\n\nTimothy Nieman: There is no doubt that decency is at issue in this case. In my experience I have never seen an issue that has brought so many people together from differing political, religious and social viewpoints. Even Senators Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell have joined forces in support of Mr. Snyder and in opposition to Westboro. Having said that, in my opinion, the captive audience doctrine protects all families from funeral protests. The decision in this case should be moral, decent and constitutional.\n\nWashington, D.C.: What's your prediction? How will the Supreme Court vote this one out?\n\nTimothy Nieman: One of the first things I learned as a lawyer is that you cannot predict how a judge or jury will decide a particular case. In my opinion I think the Court will decide this case in favor of Mr. Snyder.\n\nTimothy Nieman: Thank you for the thoughtful questions and I apologize for not being able to answer them all. I would also like to thank my colleagues Dean Dusinberre and Amanda Lavis for their work on the brief that we filed on behalf of the VFW. If you would like to read a copy of the brief, it can be found at www.rhoads-sinon.com. The Court is scheduled to hear the case this coming Wednesday; it should be an extremely interesting event.

This year's preliminary exam was his fourth attempt. \"The only idea is, this is a prestigious exam, once you make it through everyone would start respecting you.\"\n\nAnd respect there is in plenty.

No effort is made to explain what the services entail, points out Kalrav Mishra, a successful candidate. \"If a company is hiring for a position, it will have a job profile, it is easy to find out what the job entails. In the civil services there is no such thing.\"\n\nApart from the highly desired services like foreign, administrative and police, the examination sorts successful candidates into a range of less-desired, arguably less glamorous services such as revenue, taxation and customs. Those assigned to the states must work at the grassroots as representatives of the government to the people, implementing essential schemes and maintaining law and order.\n\nEach of these services require diverse skill sets and knowledge, some of which is developed during a one- to two-year training for successful candidates. There is, however, no aptitude testing, and no attention is paid to your existing academic specialization or work experience.\n\n\"It is presumed that your [final test] rank signifies your aptitude for a specific service,\" said Mishra. He gave the example of a person who may not be fluent in English, but can be assigned to the foreign services.

The network\u2019s eligible bachelors and bachelorettes are free to opt into any pre-arranged events listed on the website.\n\n\u201cThe concept revolves around small-group dating, which creates an intimate and common bond around food,\u201d CEO Andrew Connell told Mashable.\n\nEvents are listed under \u201cFind Dinners.\u201d Under this tab, you\u2019ll find events listed by date, location and specific age groups (30s and 40s, for example). After reserving your seat at the table, you\u2019ll be able to invite single friends or the cutie you\u2019ve seen on the website. There are no magic formulas or mathematical algorithms making hypothetical matches. Rather, members can choose which restaurants to go to.\n\nAt least six people are guaranteed to be at each group date. Most dinner groups range from 8 to 10 eaters, with a maximum of 12.\n\n\u201cYou use the platform to express your interest in other people. If someone expresses interest in you then that becomes a mutual match,\u201d Connell said.\n\nIf someone you\u2019ve noted as \u201cinteresting\u201d on the platform books a dinner, you\u2019ll be alerted to join. This enables members to show up when they can \u201cwithout a formal request, which keeps pressure low,\u201d according to Connell.\n\nThe pressure is also off because attendees won\u2019t have to worry about a thing during the meal. DinnerDate pre-negotiates a menu which you can order from. The company charges each person up front for their meal and gratuities when they sign up for an event so there\u2019s no worry about the bill. Users also have up until 24 hours before the date to cancel if they need to.\n\nSo far, the team has orchestrated 120 dinner group dates. The team says 80% of dinner daters come back for another date. For now, DinnerDate is only available in San Diego and Orlando.

During a recent demonstration, the curated content featured articles from The New York Times, The Washington Post and Time Magazine, among others.\n\nThe move is part of Facebook\u2019s long-term strategy to be more than just a popular app, or a destination on the Internet. Facebook wants to be the global hub of human communication, essential in the lives of its users.\n\nIt\u2019s also part of a Facebook push to develop a suite of apps that will co-exist alongside the main Facebook app. So far, the effort has had mixed results: CEO Mark Zuckerberg Wednesday said use of Facebook\u2019s Messenger app had increased 70% during the past three months. Facebook\u2019s instant-message Poke app has been less successful. Zuckerberg Wednesday hinted at more apps to come.\n\nPaper, which was demonstrated to The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, is smooth and sleek, performing most of the functions in Facebook\u2019s existing mobile app. But Paper has some important new features, including an interactive way of looking at photos that utilizes gyroscopic and other sensors inside mobile phones. The feature allows users to pan back and forth across a photo simply by moving the phone from side to side.\n\nPaper displays information in segments \u2014 such as Headlines, Pop Life, Score, Enterprise and Home \u2013 similar to the sections of a newspaper.

The dismal data, released by the Census Bureau on Wednesday, followed a disappointing report on sales of existing homes earlier in the week and added to growing concerns about the strength of the economic recovery.\n\nUnemployment remains stubbornly high as private sector employers do not add jobs and retail sales are weak. And if no one seems to want to buy a house, many other people apparently are voluntarily ditching the ones they already have.\n\nFannie Mae, the big mortgage finance company that is a ward of the government, said Wednesday that homeowners who intentionally defaulted because they owed much more than the house was worth would be ineligible for a new Fannie Mae-backed loan for seven years.\n\n\u201cWalking away from a mortgage is bad for borrowers and bad for communities and our approach is meant to deter the disturbing trend toward strategic defaulting,\u201d Terence Edwards, Fannie Mae\u2019s executive vice president for credit portfolio management, said in a statement.\n\nFannie Mae and its sister company Freddie Mac own or guarantee about 30 million mortgages. The new measures could help limit demand for houses for much of the next decade.\n\nFannie Mae said it would take legal action to recoup outstanding mortgage debt from borrowers who walk away. According to one study, 588,000 borrowers strategically defaulted in 2008.\n\nOther economic news on Wednesday was downbeat.\n\nPolicy makers at the Federal Reserve, meeting in Washington, said that \u201cfinancial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth.\u201d As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep short-term interest rates near zero.\n\nEven as mortgage rates fell again last week, flirting with their modern-day lows, the Mortgage Bankers Association said that applications for loans to purchase homes fell. It was the fifth drop in six weeks for the purchase index, which is 36.8 percent below its level in June 2009.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get the phones to ring,\u201d said Michael E. Menatian, president of the Sanborn Mortgage Corporation in West Hartford, Conn. \u201cUntil there is economic growth \u2014 i.e., more jobs, wage appreciation, overtime and bonuses \u2014 we will have a housing problem.\u201d\n\nBuilders sold new homes in May at an annual rate of 300,000, the Census Bureau said. That was 32.7 percent below the 446,000 rate in April, when buyers could still qualify for a tax credit, and is about a third the level in a normal economy.\n\nAnalysts had been expecting a drop to about 400,000. \u201cWe would be lying if we said the size of the drop was not shocking,\u201d Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, said in a research note.\n\nSales are now even lower than they were during the recession of the early 1980s, when interest rates approached 20 percent. The previous record low was September 1981.\n\n\u201cI think that builders should bite the bullet and stop building houses,\u201d said Howard Glaser, a housing consultant. \u201cThey keep dumping new inventory into the market when what the market really needs is a moratorium.\u201d\n\nThe builders maintain that they build only when they have orders from customers, and that their buyers are not interested in older stock. But the result is the same: too many houses, new and old, are competing for too few buyers.\n\nThe situation will likely get worse over the summer. In a normal market, the supply of homes available is less than six months. Currently, there are more than eight months\u2019 worth of both new and existing homes.\n\nWith more foreclosures headed to the market, those numbers will likely go up.\n\nGovernment data released Wednesday showed that newly initiated foreclosures increased 18.6 percent during the first quarter, to 371,000. Foreclosures in process increased 8.5 percent, to 1.17 million.\n\nUnder the system announced Wednesday by Fannie Mae, owners who walk away from their mortgages will be penalized even more than those who filed for multiple bankruptcy protection. Multiple filers are eligible for a new Fannie-backed mortgage after five years.\n\nA Fannie spokeswoman said executives were not being made available to comment. The release did not address the question of how Fannie intended to distinguish between those who walk away and those who really could not avoid foreclosure.\n\nAnalysts and economists are growing more discouraged about the housing market; a majority said in one new survey that they expected prices to decline again this year. The size of the drop will be dictated by whether the market\u2019s current queasiness is a temporary reaction to the end of the $8,000 tax credit or a more permanent malaise.\n\nBuyers who signed contracts before April 30 qualified for the credit. These purchases will turn up in sales reports as they are completed.\n\nWhile the credit clearly stimulated sales, the effect was milder than anticipated. The National Association of Realtors said this week that existing houses sold in May at an annual rate of 5.66 million, down slightly from April.\n\nAt a mortgage conference last month, David H. Stevens, Federal Housing Administration commissioner, said housing was \u201ca market purely on life support, sustained by the federal government. Having F.H.A. do this much volume is a sign of a very sick system.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview, Mr. Stevens said his point was misconstrued. \u201cThe system is showing signs of stabilizing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re vastly improved over where we were a year ago.\u201d\n\nTo underline that notion, the Obama administration released this week its first monthly \u201chousing scorecard.\u201d It presents an optimistic picture of a housing market saved from the abyss by extensive government intervention.\n\nSome of its good news, however, was distinctly relative. \u201cHome equity up more than $1 trillion since first quarter 2009,\u201d said one headline in the report.

Congress did little to address it.\n\n\"If you were looking for reassurance that somebody took this seriously in Washington, you weren't finding much,\" Whitehouse said.\n\nWhy the renewed focus on climate change?\n\nClimate change turned into an issue that few wanted to touch, especially those facing difficult reelection campaigns.\n\nWhen Democrats tried to pass legislation that would have capped carbon emissions, skepticism around climate change reached an all-time high.\n\nAccording to Gallup, 48% of respondents said the issue on its face is exaggerated.\n\nOpponents, led by organizations and businesses involved in the fossil fuel industry, successfully turned public opinion and stopped any efforts in its tracks.\n\nThe death of climate change\n\nOpponents successfully renamed cap and trade, which referred to legislation that placed limits on carbon emissions by power plants and other major polluters, to \"cap and tax.\"\n\nAmid recession, they argued the proposal would kill jobs and raise energy prices.\n\nKey players in changing the dynamic of the debate were the Koch Brothers, billionaire businessmen who made their fortune in the oil and gas industry and have also spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to defeat Democrats.\n\nCap and trade would have cut into Koch industries' revenue, which is estimated to hover around $100 billion per year.\n\nTim Phillips, the President of Americans for Prosperity, the political organization backed by the Kochs, said that killing climate change legislation in a Democratic-controlled Washington was his organization's major accomplishment.\n\n\"Stopping cap and trade was a crucial policy victory that most folks would have thought impossible at the time,\" he said during a recent interview. \"Defeating that was an enormous policy victory that has lasting policy repercussions in a good way.\"\n\nNot only did they kill the legislation, they successfully helped to elect a crop of new lawmakers who don't believe that human activity is the cause of global warming.\n\nAccording to the League of Conservation Voters, 100 lawmakers currently fall into their ranks.\n\nWhitehouse had this response: It's \"something that his grandchildren will be very ashamed of.\"\n\nOpinion: Why are we still debating climate change?\n\nThe top Republican in the Senate, Sen. Mitch McConnell, took to the floor Monday afternoon to deride the climate change talkers as \"cruel.\"\n\n\"Families are losing work because of government attacks on the coal industry,\" McConnell said, referring to his home state of Kentucky. \"And tonight you're going to hear 30 hours of excuses from a group of people who think that's OK. Well it's not OK. It's cruel.\"\n\nThe death of cap and trade triggered new fears among environmentally friendly legislators.\n\n\"It is unfortunate,\" Whitehouse said. \"History will look back at the propaganda effort of the carbon polluters as one of the most sophisticated and complex propaganda efforts that human kind had to withstand.\"\n\nBut since then, the public has started to shift its opinion.\n\nAccording to Gallup, 41% now say that climate change is exaggerated -- 7 points lower than its high in 2010. And the number of those who say the seriousness of the issue is underestimated is on the rise.\n\nNow Whitehouse thinks it's his side's turn to make a move. He has buy in from the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid who told reporters last week that it is \"the worst problem\" the world faces.\n\nBut they have to start at Square One by working to convince the public that climate change is real.\n\nThe Senate's all-night session is well-timed.\n\nWealthy former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer is willing to spend Koch-like money to push the issue of climate change and defeat skeptics in the 2014 midterms.\n\nWhitehouse, who has known Steyer since college, said if he can make good on his pledge to infuse the effort with $100 million, he would \"help to neutralize an incredibly one-sided spending.\"\n\n\"We can change the conversation very quickly.\"\n\nBut not all Democrats - and no Republicans - are on board. Notable senators were absent from the overnight session Monday into Tuesday.\n\nThey include those who have difficult election campaigns, including Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska.\n\nRepublicans aren't letting Landrieu's absence go unnoticed.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, which aims to get Republicans elected to the Senate, put out a web video Tuesday, criticizing Landrieu for allowing the talk-a-thon to take place. The video also argues she doesn't stand up enough for American energy.\n\nTiernan Sittenfeld, a senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters, said the fact that just over half of the Democratic caucus is willing to speak in the wee hours of the night about climate change is \"incredibly exciting\" and \"good politics.\"\n\nIn fact, Whitehouse is working to ensure that climate change is a topic in the 2016 presidential race by traveling to Iowa next week to talk to voters and activists.\n\nHe insists he is not running for President but wants to make sure those who do talk about the impact of climate change.\n\nAfter a hiatus post 2010, the Obama administration is also back in the climate change game.\n\nPresident Barack Obama proposed his Climate Action Plan this past summer that would create carbon pollution standards for power plants and expand renewable energy production. And in his new budget plan, the President proposed funding to study the impacts of climate change.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said last month that climate change is the \"greatest challenge of our generation.\"\n\nWhitehouse is optimistic that the tide is turning. So much so that he traveled to Sea Island, Georgia, this past weekend to speak at the conservative American Enterprise Institute conference.\n\n\"I think it went pretty well,\" he said.\n\nIs it time to agree on climate change?\n\nCNN's Ted Barrett, Ashley Killough and Jonathan Helman contributed to this story.", "summary": "If insomnia kicks in tonight, you can watch the Senate.

There\u2019s already a long list of places she won\u2019t go with him because of germs, foods she won\u2019t let him eat because of alleged health risks, etc.\n\nThe other day I offhandedly mentioned that maybe our sons would play sports together when they\u2019re older, and she replied that there\u2019s \u201cno chance in hell\u201d she will allow her son to play sports because of the risks of injuries.\n\nIs there anything I can or should say or do to get her to relax a bit and understand that children aren\u2019t quite as fragile as she thinks they are?\n\nIn-Law: It would be nice if you could productively say, \u201cProtecting kids from everything has a much bigger risk: That they\u2019ll be emotionally stunted and afraid of their own shadows. I know you mean well and you\u2019re being the best mom you can, but I think the healthiest thing you can do for both of you right now is to seek treatment for your anxiety.\u201d\n\nSince I know how powerfully that can backfire, though, I\u2019ll suggest instead that you talk to the family member between you (her spouse or yours, right?) to plant the seed that there\u2019s serious trouble brewing in her protectiveness and that a mental-health screening would be an excellent idea.\n\nYour reach is limited since it\u2019s not your spouse or child, but you can sound an important alarm. You can also recommend one of a depressing array of books begging parents to unclench enough to let their kids be kids. Good luck.\n\nDear Carolyn: I was recently at a VERY fancy dinner with my fiance, and we were seated at a table in the back near the desk where waiters run checks. I asked the hostess if we could sit somewhere else. She didn\u2019t have another table, and I said we wouldn\u2019t mind waiting at the bar until one became available. About 10 minutes later we were seated at a much nicer table. I found out later that my fiance was mortified \u2014 was I rude?\n\nSwitching Tables: Nope. It\u2019s your night out and your prerogative to request the experience you\u2019d prefer, within the limits of what the restaurant can reasonably provide. That can mean waiting for a window seat, choosing not to shiver under the A/C vent or putting as much distance as you need between your too-rare, no-kids date night and the party with three kids younger than 6.\n\nI\u2019m more interested, though, in the gap (or two) between your comfort level and your fiance\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re assertive like this? He doesn\u2019t advocate for himself likewise? Are there other areas where you\u2019re mismatched and/or this unaware of each other\u2019s natures?\n\nThere may not be too many VERY fancy dinners in your future, but his discomfort exposes something that\u2019s consequential to your daily life together. If simple assertiveness is just how you roll, then both of you will want him to be okay with that. Not just okay \u2014 you want a life partner to embrace the qualities that are germane to who you are.\n\nWrite to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.

Some of them got their first tattoo impulsively, others planned their design for years until they found the right artist. Some women just like the way tattoos look when they see their reflection in the mirror, others feel a deep connection to the symbols they have chosen to mark on their body.\n\nTalk to a woman about her tattoos for an hour, and you will have a rich conversation about art, beauty, identity and gender politics. But mainstream engagement with tattooed women seldom explores this. We may think tatoos are no longer taboo, but positive representations of tattooed women are few and far between.\n\nWomen with Tattoos is a project that hopes to introduce a new kind of image, one with which women can identify. It began in 2013, when my friend Christina Theisen and I created a photography series to show that there was more than one type of woman who expresses herself through tattoos. The people we photographed came from around the UK and my hometown, Athens, Greece.\n\nI continue to photograph women of all ages and backgrounds (the youngest is 21, the oldest is 86) and while most live in London, many increasingly make a special trip to the city. By exploring the layers that lie under the surface of our skin, this project has helped me understand how we navigate life through our bodies.\n\nThe women I have photographed say tattoos have helped them process difficult experiences. \u201cWhen I was being tattooed,\u201d Gabriella Apicella (pictured) says, \u201cit was as though the needle was uncovering these images on my arm, rather than adding them.\u201d\n\nThe most significant realisation is that the tattooed female body can challenge society\u2019s obsession with ageing and the types of bodies that are permitted to be visible or on show.\n\nCarey Marvin, who got her first tattoo in her late 50s, describes being \u201csurprised at how altered my feelings about my body were once there was art on it. I stand taller. I am conscious of how I move. I love this body for the art on it.

These women, and some men, recount not only the rapes, but also the institutions\u2019 often weak responses. After its premiere to largely favorable reviews at Sundance in January, it had a spring theatrical release, and is scheduled to be broadcast next Thursday on CNN.\n\nDefenders of the film say the criticism from those faculty members, among them prominent black and feminist legal scholars, is misdirected and focused too much on the legal findings.\n\n\u201cThe documentary has created an important conversation about campus sexual assault,\u201d said Diane L. Rosenfeld, a Harvard law lecturer who also appears in the film and did not sign the letter. \u201cWe need to be rolling up our sleeves and really figuring out what kind of preventative education programs to develop which create a culture of sexual respect.\u201d\n\nBut in their letter, the law professors, who include Laurence H. Tribe, Randall L. Kennedy and Jeannie C. Suk, said the film \u201cprovides a seriously false picture both of the general sexual assault phenomenon at universities and of our student,\u201d specifically a male Harvard law student whose case is included in \u201cThe Hunting Ground.\u201d\n\nUnidentified in the film but named in the professors\u2019 letter, the student, Brandon Winston, was accused by another law student, Kamilah Willingham, of sexually assaulting both her and a friend when they passed out after a night of drinking. Harvard Law expelled Mr. Winston, but a grand jury did not indict him on the most serious charges, choosing instead two counts of indecent assault and battery against the friend. He was convicted of a misdemeanor nonsexual assault. After reviewing his case, Harvard Law readmitted him.\n\nBut the film, its dissenters say, left the erroneous impression that the student was not only guilty but also probably a serial offender who drugged his victims.\n\n\u201cThis is a young human being whose life has been mauled by this process for years, and now he has to walk around campus with people saying, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a repeat sexual offender,\u2019 and he\u2019s not,\u201d said Janet Halley, one of the letter\u2019s authors. \u201cIt\u2019s not a documentary. It\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\nHow colleges are dealing with sexual assaults has come to the fore of the national conversation. In September, a year after the Obama administration started an initiative called \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d to tackle campus sexual violence, the Association of American Universities released its finding, from a survey of more than 150,000 students at 27 universities, that nearly a quarter of female undergraduates were the victims of sexual assault and misconduct. At Harvard, which had the highest response rate of all the schools surveyed, 31 percent of female seniors said they had been the target of nonconsensual sexual contact.\n\nHarvard had been roiled by internal fractiousness over its handling of sexual assaults. In the fall of 2014, Ms. Halley, along with 27 current and former law professors, denounced the university\u2019s adoption of a new sexual harassment and sexual violence policy. The procedures, they wrote in a letter published in The Boston Globe, \u201clack the most basic elements of fairness and due process\u201d and \u201care overwhelmingly stacked against the accused.\u201d Sixteen of those signatories went on to sign the most recent letter.\n\nLast December, the Department of Education found the law school in violation of Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funds, for its response to sexual assaults.\n\nMeanwhile, criticism has been lobbed at \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d for months. Shortly after its theatrical release, The Harvard Crimson faulted the filmmakers\u2019 calculation of the college\u2019s sexual assault statistics, and, in June, Emily Yoffe published a blistering takedown in Slate of the documentary\u2019s presentation of Ms. Willingham\u2019s case.\n\nCNN has defended the film, saying, \u201cWe are confident that both the film and our extensive associated coverage give this important issue the full and fair treatment it deserves.\u201d\n\nThe filmmakers have been just as staunch, posting a rebuttal to Ms. Yoffe\u2019s article on their website. And they were equally quick to respond to the letter, which has become a sharply divisive issue on the Harvard campus.\n\n\u201cEverything in \u2018The Hunting Ground\u2019 is accurate and we fully stand behind our Harvard Law survivor\u2019s account of her assault, as well as the accounts of all the subjects in our film,\u201d Mr. Dick and Ms. Ziering wrote in a text message to a New York Times reporter. \u201cStudies confirm that failed policies on campuses overwhelmingly favor perpetrators, enabling them to commit crimes with impunity. Where are the letters of outrage from these professors decrying this grave injustice which has been going on for decades, and has a devastating impact on survivors, their families and our society?\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of a capsule summary for this article on the Apple Watch misstated the name of a documentary about sexual assault on campus. As the article correctly notes, it is \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d not \u201cThe Hunting Grounds.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on November 14, 2015, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Professors Dispute Rape Documentary.

(Via Telephone): Oh, no, we're all in Illinois still. And I got to tell you, this is not what democracy looks like. You asked the other senator how much notice is supposed to be given, it's usually a 24-hour notice, OK? And there was no 24-hour notice. There was no draft of the bill in front of anyone on that conference committee. And so 18 Republican senators stole democracy from the people of the state of Wisconsin today.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, you say that, usually, that's 24-hour notice. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's what the rule requires. And I still haven't gotten an idea of whether the rule is specific about how much notice must be given. But certainly, sir, I mean, you can't be surprised by the Republicans doing this. There's been the threat that they were going to sever out the collective bargaining and vote separately. So you must have known this was coming.\n\nCOGGS: Oh, no. We never knew that they would go ahead and attempt to steal democracy from the people and then close the capitol so that the people would not have a voice to speak. I mean, this is unheralded. In all these years, you know, we've never had an incident like this, where they would just, you know, take democracy from the people. And yet in one night, one day Republicans stole democracy from the people, the workers ...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Wait. You say -- sir, I'm having a hard time understanding this \"steal the democracy\" aspect. If they are lawfully elected, if they followed the rules, and if you got outmaneuvered because you're a couple hours away and if they didn't violate the notice requirement and if they could sever out the collective bargaining from the statute without any sort of legal impediment, you just got outmaneuvered, at least tonight.\n\nCOGGS: No, they ... but they did not do it legally. That's what I'm saying. We're saying that...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Where is it?\n\nCOGGS: ... legally, they did not notice (INAUDIBLE) and they didn't notify Senator Miller of the meeting. He was supposed to be in this committee meeting [and] they didn't notify him in time for him to get back.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, here's what the senate chief clerk, Rob Marchin, writes. And I don't know if he's a Democrat or a Republican or if he is someone who's just -- who's a public employee on neither side.\n\nBut what he says, what he wrote, is that \"There was some discussion today about the notice provided for the legislature's conference committee. In special session under Senate rule 93, no advance notice is required, other than posting on the legislative bulletin board. Despite this rule, it was decided to provide a two-hour notice by posting on the bulletin board. My staff\" -- this is the senate chief clerk's staff -- \"e-mailed a copy of the notice to all legislative offices at 4:10 PM central time, which gave the impression that the notice may have been slightly less than two hours. Either way, the notices appears to have satisfied the requirements of the rules and statutes.\"\n\nAnd that's by Rob Marchin. Is he a Republican or is he someone who is a civil servant in Wisconsin with no party affiliation?\n\nCOGGS: No, no, he's neutral. But as you just said, they did not follow the constitution. They didn't give the even two-hour emergency notice. And they didn't notify my office.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Well, I'm not going to -- I mean, I'm only telling you what he says. He says that notice appears to have satisfied the requirements. He doesn't say for certain, but he says it appears to have satisfied the requirements of the rules. So I take it that will be a battle. So what is the sort of -- what is the collective plan for the senate Democrats now in light of what's happened tonight? What are you going to do?\n\nCOGGS: Well, we're going to see what happens in the assembly. Then we're going to have a game plan on how we take back democracy. We're going to join the people of the state of Wisconsin and take back democracy because they are mad as hell. It's not ... they're mad as hell. They're not going to take this anymore.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: When you say, take back democracy, what does -- what do you -- I'm having a hard time understanding specifically what you're going to do. Are you going to -- is it to seek recall of Republican senators, try to get them bumped from office? Is that what you mean?\n\nCOGGS: Oh, yes, recall [is] part of it. We think that the electorate in the state of Wisconsin is so mad that at least eight Republicans will be recalled in a short fashion. Twenty-seven percent of the signatures (INAUDIBLE) weekend. Twenty percent of the signatures were collected against (INAUDIBLE) weekend. (INAUDIBLE) nothing but snowfall, and so Republicans now are in trouble because the people have awakened. They have awakened a sleeping giant.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Is there any reason whatsoever for you not to return to Wisconsin now?\n\nCOGGS: Well, once again, we're going to see how the assembly treats this bill. Then we're going to, as the \"Wisconsin 14,\" come together and make a decision on how we take back democracy with the people of the state of Wisconsin.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Senator, thank you. And of course, we'll be watching this because this is quite a fascinating story, and a very serious, important one to the people of Wisconsin, as well. Thank you, sir.", "summary": "<p>Wis.

He made his fortune after World War II selling chain-saw equipment for a once-burly timber industry in the Pacific Northwest, riding the crest of America\u2019s first real housing boom. So he called a friend, who set up a meeting with Habitat\u2019s local chief executive in east Portland. \u201cWould $1 million in cash help out in the effort?\u201d Mr. Gray asked.\n\nHis philanthropy in turn opened doors with other donors, including a lumber company heir who had never given to Habitat, but who was inspired by Mr. Gray\u2019s example to chip in $250,000. Mr. Gray then upped the ante again, adding another $1 million to the statewide Habitat for Humanity office.\n\nThis spring, the first 22 homes in the largest Habitat project in Oregon history \u2014 a 65-unit subdivision left partly built by a private developer who abandoned it when the market crashed \u2014 are rising on Portland\u2019s east side. Habitat, meanwhile, has become the 10th-largest home builder in the Portland metropolitan area by housing volume, according to a local building trades association, and even more dominant on the lower-income east side through the $10 million land-bank fund that Mr. Gray helped anchor.\n\nThe 150 lots bought by the fund will keep the group busy for five years or more, even as it has increased its home-building output by 50 percent, to 30 homes a year from 20.\n\n\u201cRecirculation,\u201d Mr. Gray said in describing his money\u2019s new path, from the old lumber and construction scene of the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 the G.I. Bill, suburbia on the rise, America in its lion phase on the world stage \u2014 to the new era of wounded, postcrash housing economics. \u201cWhat they were doing seemed like a smart idea,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Habitat branches have also pivoted in the recession, trying different angles in a dark time. In Nevada and Florida, for example, some Habitat groups stopped new construction entirely and shifted to renovation, buying abandoned properties in cities racked by high foreclosure rates. Across most of the nation, one-at-a-time houses, financed by church suppers and staffed by volunteer hammer swingers, are still the norm for Habitat, an ecumenical Christian group that was founded in 1976 in Georgia.\n\nBut business leaders and housing experts said Portland \u2014 partly through Habitat\u2019s timing in betting big in a down market, partly through a donor network led by Mr. Gray that stepped up to help even as corporate support mostly collapsed \u2014 was creating something that would resonate long after the recession: Habitat neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThat fact that John Gray had given us $1 million gave us legitimacy,\u201d said Steve Messinetti, the president and chief executive of Habitat Portland/ Metro East. \u201cAnd then the market, and the depressed prices, allowed us to carry out our goals.\u201d\n\nThe scale and scope of the new Habitat projects, city officials say, will allow entire blocks on the east side to be anchored by owner-occupied housing. Those owners, under Habitat\u2019s model, would earn 30 percent to 60 percent of the median Portland area household income (around $20,000 to $40,000 a year for a family of four), living in homes they helped build themselves, and paying down their mortgages with zero-interest nonprofit loans.\n\n\u201cAs a housing commissioner, we feel like we\u2019re trying to plug a lot of leaks in the dike,\u201d said Nick Fish, a Portland city commissioner in charge of the housing bureau and parks and recreation. And the city\u2019s budget has still not recovered from the downturn. Habitat, especially in east Portland, he said, is filling the gap.\n\n\u201cOne of the ideas that they have floated is a plan, outside government, to take back blocks of the city, block by block, using their tool kit, with modest government contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can start building around their work.\u201d\n\nThere was a kind of bleakly fortuitous stroke of luck in the Habitat capital project, Mr. Fish and other housing experts said. The area that Mr. Messinetti\u2019s Habitat branch was focused on, east Portland, was also the hardest hit by what Mr. Fish called the \u201cpredatory lending and foreclosure mess.\u201d The city expanded its boundary east into what had been an unincorporated area in 1988, he said, and the final, frothy wave of the easy-money era broke there in an area that never shared the hip West Coast prosperity of downtown.\n\nNow, as the economy here and along much of the coastal strip north to Seattle is recovering, vacant land in Portland is being snatched up. A big national homebuilder based in Miami, the Lennar Corporation, said in December that it was expanding in the Portland and Seattle markets, and prices for vacant land have soared, said Dave Nielsen, the chief executive of the Homebuilders Association of Metro Portland. \u201cGood for them,\u201d he said, referring to Habitat. \u201cIf they were trying to do it now, they\u2019d be in a bidding battle.\u201d\n\nMr. Gray said that for him part of the appeal of a big Habitat play was the idea that social stability of families and neighborhoods and economic stability in housing go together. It is a lesson, he said, from personal experience. He grew up in the 1920s and \u201930s, the son of a rural schoolteacher who was widowed young and raised three boys in a four-room house with no running water.\n\nOn the dining room table of his downtown apartment, he pulled out a family album, stabbing a picture of the house with his finger, still amazed after more than 80 years that his mother\u2019s landlord, a farm family, never raised the rent \u2014 $2.50 a month \u2014 even after rural electrification came through in the 1930s.\n\nSenator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who started his career at Habitat for Humanity, said he thought the housing bust, and Habitat\u2019s new chapter here, had validated the idea that different economic models have value.\n\nMany of the families he worked with two decades ago in east Portland, for example, are still in their homes, he said, and the homes those families bought for $30,000 to $50,000 back then are now in some cases worth five times as much.\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:\n\nAn earlier version of this article contained a photo caption that misidentified\u00c2 Justin Collinson as\u00c2 Ryan Dunn and described the image incorrectly.

When I met Crane for lunch a couple weeks ago, no sooner had we sat down than he began singing the praises of this new contraption he had in his basement. The machine \u2014 which can generate 10 kilowatts of continuous power, fed by Crane\u2019s natural gas line \u2014 is a new iteration of an old creation, the Stirling engine. This version, called the Beacon 10, was created after a decade of engineering by famed inventor Dean Kamen.\n\nI caught up with Kamen (who is best known for creating the Segway scooter) over the phone last week to ask him about the device. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned his basement into an extension of our laboratory,\u201d said Kamen. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a machine made for the typical home, but he has a gigantic swimming pool and a huge house.\u201d\n\nWith the Beacon 10, says Kamen, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to feel guilty heating up the pool.\u201d That\u2019s because of the highly efficient nature of the Stirling engine. First conceived in 1816 by Scottish minister Robert Stirling, the device in its simplest form consists of applying an external heat source to a closed cylinder where the cyclical expansion and compression of air inside the cylinder drives the pistons up and down. Unlike your car, where fuel is combusted inside the engine, the Stirling is an external combustion engine; it can work with any external heat source.\n\nThe Stirling is quieter than an internal combustion engine, and it\u2019s more efficient because the heat is retained inside the engine by to do more work rather than allowed to escape to the environment.\n\nKamen\u2019s Beacon 10 Stirling engine. (Courtesy Deka Research)\n\nThough Stirlings are highly efficient, they haven\u2019t caught on because it takes them a while to warm up and they can\u2019t change power output quickly. That makes them unworkable for cars and trucks, but potentially ideal both for power generation and water heating. More than just a backup generator, these machines, depending on the price of natural gas, could also provide round-the-clock power to a home or business. Beats solar panels.\n\nKamen\u2019s contribution has been in engineering his Stirling with the most high-performance materials. He started off using skilled welders to put together key parts of the engine made out of exotic alloys. More recently he\u2019s figured out how make those pieces with even more precision using 3-D printing. Crane says a key element in Kamen design was the perfection of a little plastic membrane that looks like a condom. The Beacon, which weighs about 1,500 pounds and is the size of a washing machine, also includes a battery system, which can be integrated with other distributed generation systems like solar panels.\n\nSo what\u2019s Kamen\u2019s vision for the future of these things? Well the one in Crane\u2019s basement is far too big for the average American home, generating 10 continuous kilowatts, while most of us only draw about 2 kw. \u201cI love bulldozers, but I wouldn\u2019t put one in my garage,\u201d quips Kamen.\n\nKamen believes that aside from mansion owners, the Beacon 10 is just right for businesses like laundries or restaurants that use a lot of hot water. With commercialization partner NRG Energy, he\u2019s so far deployed roughly 20 of the machines.\n\nKamen expects to put them into production within 18 months. \u201cWithin two years I would expect high-end builders to be installing them.\u201d\n\nBut the 10 kw models are just the beginning. It won\u2019t be long before Kamen has a smaller version ready for commercialization. He\u2019s already been running a 2.5 kw Beacon at his New Hampshire home for four years.\n\nWhy not offer the smaller version first? \u201cA 2-kilowatt machine would make one-fifth the power, but wouldn\u2019t cost just one-fifth the money,\u201d says Kamen. That\u2019s why he and NRG will be relying on high-tech early adopters, such as Tesla owners, to buy the first run.\n\nAs for cost? Kamen thinks that the 10 kw versions can be manufactured and installed for roughly $10,000 or about $1 per watt. That, however, wouldn\u2019t cover development costs, overhead, or profit margin.\n\nIt will be up to Crane\u2019s NRG to determine what to charge for these Beacon machines. A big part of NRG\u2019s plan isn\u2019t to sell them at all, but lease them. Leasing equipment to homeowners and businesses is the same model that NRG and solar-installer upstart SolarCity SolarCity have applied to solar panels. The homeowner leases them for 20 years or so, and agrees to pay NRG a fee per kwh that their own roof generates. If the panels make excess juice, then NRG can make money selling it onto the grid.\n\nThe idea is to try the same thing with the Beacon machines. Once the adoption rate is high enough, NRG will be able to network dozens of the devices across a region together. Depending on natural gas prices and levels of electricity demand, there could be times when NRG would send a signal to all the Beacon machines in a region to ramp up to full output and send the excess power onto the grid. \u201dWe don\u2019t think we should be just selling a box,\u201d says Kamen. \u201cWe think we should be part of a system of the future, powering the evolution of microgrids.\u201d", "summary": "\"Ten years from today the probability that you are depending on wires hanging on tree branches is as likely as that you'll still be installing land lines for telephones.

After crossing the Mexico border with her mother and two sisters at 6, she grew up in Southern California and joined the military after high school. She was stationed in Iraq for 15 months. When she returned to the states, Tejada was working as a mechanic when she began making YouTube videos in 2008 as a way to add more femininity to her life.

What\u2019s that like? It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s unbelievable\u2014I never thought it would get to a million. When I first started, it was so hard to get 100.\n\nWhat did you do to get to a million? I\u2019ve been really consistent with all my videos. I\u2019m still a natural, ordinary girl.\n\nHow do you think you\u2019ve changed? When I first started out, I was in the military. I was a soldier, I wasn\u2019t married, I didn\u2019t have my son, didn\u2019t have a lot of money, and I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with myself. So I grew as a person, and I\u2019ve had tons of great opportunities with YouTube being my platform. I\u2019ve changed a lot, but in a really positive way.\n\nDid it change your style? Yes, tremendously. I\u2019m so embarrassed by my videos from 2008.\n\nI\u2019ll have to go an look at them now! [Laughs.] No! Don\u2019t look at them!\n\nJust kidding. I feel like deleting them, but I won\u2019t. Anyway, as far as my style goes, I\u2019ve been influenced by the world that I\u2019m in now. And the girls, my friends, are all pretty fashionable so they inspire me as well. I know a lot more about makeup now, too.\n\nI saw your most recent makeup collection video. What does it feel like to have that? You know, when I first started, I didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so for me to have, like, MAC blotting powder, that was the biggest deal. So, now, to go to the store and buy anything from MAC and to build my collection to what it is now, it\u2019s pretty crazy.\n\nYou probably get sent a lot of stuff too. Yeah, but I always give it to my sisters if I don\u2019t need it, or my mom. That\u2019s Wendy, my little sister [points to a young girl smiling nearby]. Right now she\u2019s a little shy, but she\u2019s the center of attention.\n\nWalk me through the process of one of your videos. Well, first I do my research, just to see what video I\u2019m going to do. Then I start to brainstorm and write out a little story line to make sure everything\u2019s nice and organized, especially if it\u2019s going to be a fashion look. Then I start the whole getting-ready process, and I\u2019ll pick out the outfits if it\u2019s going to be a styling video and then we plan days when we\u2019re going to shoot at the park or at the beach. But it\u2019s always just me and Jesse, working together.\n\nOh yeah, he\u2019s my son.\n\nSo how long does that take? If it\u2019s just a haul video, it takes maybe an hour to film and an hour to edit, but if it\u2019s a styling video, it takes me a whole week, to plan it, film it in certain locations, to travel, edit it \u2026 those take a little bit longer.\n\nAny other current projects? We\u2019re working on designing a jewelry collection, and then hopefully that translates into a clothing line. The goal is to be sold in department stores. It\u2019s not going to be really expensive.\n\nOn your shopping site, the clothing is very affordable. Yeah, we started that just because girls already buy what I wear anyway, so it was an easier way for me to style the outfit and for them to get the look that I\u2019m wearing.\n\nAt one point you were in fashion school; are you still doing that? [Big breath.] I took some breaks from fashion school. There\u2019s just no way I can go to fashion school and do everything else. But hopefully I will be able to finish it, because I already put in two and a half years.\n\nDid that help with your buying process for the site? The buying just sort of came naturally. I just buy what I like to wear, you know. It\u2019s been working so far.\n\nYou struggled with confidence in high school. Did building such a loyal audience help with that? I still struggle with it a little bit. I\u2019m not super confident\u2026 I\u2019m actually not confident [laughs]. But yeah, in high school, it was much worse. And YouTube, actually made my self esteem rise a lot higher.\n\nWho is your Hollywood beauty crush? Jessica Alba is one of my fashion icons, just because she loves to try a lot of trends and she has her own way of personalizing them. And she just looks beautiful in anything. She follows me on Instagram! And I\u2019m obsessed with Selena Gomez, too. She\u2019s young, and super confident, and she\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s accomplished a lot of things, even though she is younger than me.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not filming or taking photos, do you stick to the same basic makeup routine? I use the same products every week. I change it up every week, because I want to use all that I have and I don\u2019t want it to expire, especially because I do have a lot of stuff.\n\nFavorite products right now? The Benefit POREfessional face primer. It helps foundation stay in place all day, it mattifies your skin and it just gives you a really nice, flawless application. I also love their skincare line.\n\nBeauty pet peeves? Sometimes I think it can be really hard to find your correct foundation shade. It\u2019s not really a pet peeve, but I feel like people should invest a little more time doing research, and, you know, testing out foundations on their actual face. And blending it on to your chest and your neck.\n\nAnd you do contouring too, right? Yes, I love bronzer, because I have a round face.\n\nI need that \u2014 which one do you recommend? Let me think. Hoola? Yes, [Benefit\u2019s] Hoola. It\u2019s a matte bronzer, and it\u2019s amazing.\n\nI thought I had a lot of makeup until I saw your video. [Laughs.]\n\nDo you have any dream goals? [Big sigh.] I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I want to do five years or 10 years from now, but one thing I aspire to be is a motivational speaker, because I love to read motivational books from Louise Hay and Joel Olsteen that are just really inspiring and uplifting. And I would love to write a book about my life.\n\nAny message to give to your fans? Something that I always tell myself, that I\u2019ve read before, is if you can think about it in your mind and dream it, you can hold it in your hands.\n\nQ&A: Beauty Entrepreneur Trish McEvoy", "summary": "Q&A with beauty vlogger Dulce Candy", "density": 1.1666666667, "coverage": 0.8333333333, "compression": 266.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/05/house-chaplain-patrick-conroy-boehner-pelosi-/1", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2011050619id_/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/05/house-chaplain-patrick-conroy-boehner-pelosi-/1", "title": "Boehner taps Catholic priest to be next House chaplain", "date": "2011050619", "text": "The Rev.

He would succeed the Rev. Daniel Coughlin, whose own appointment in 2000 was marked by an unusual level of partisan acrimony and charges of bias.\n\nBoehner said he consulted with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi about Conroy's appointment, which will be formally submitted to the House for consideration later this month.\n\nThe speaker said in a statement that Conroy, 60, has shown a \"dedication to God's work, commitment to serving others and experience working with people of faith from all traditions.\"\n\nConroy, a Jesuit ordained in 1983, has done stints as a parish priest in his native Washington state, where his parishoners included the people of the Colville Indian Reservation and the Spokane Indian Reservation.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994 and again from 1997 to 2003, he was chaplain at Georgetown University. In between, Conroy was chaplain at Seattle University.

You have company. Sometimes the people who get paid the big bucks to plow through them can't make much sense of them either.\n\nResearchers at the University of Michigan analyzed tens of thousands of 10-K reports filed by companies over a 12-year period to assess their level of readability.\n\nThe reports, yearly filings required by U.S. securities regulators, are supposed to provide a clear-eyed look at a company's performance. They tend to be drier and more technical than the glitzy illustrated annual reports that companies give their shareholders.\n\n\"The less readable these documents are, the more pressure it creates from clients for analysts to provide commentary and forecasts,\" said Feng Li, an accounting professor who worked on the study.\n\nIn other words, when ordinary investors can't make heads or tails of a report, they lean on the professionals to explain what it means.\n\n\"This increases the number of analysts who weigh in on these stocks and enhances their influence on investors, even while it reduces the analysts' collective accuracy,\" Li told Reuters.\n\nTo gauge the reports' readability, Li and two university colleagues, Reuven Lehavy and Kenneth Merkley, applied something called the Fog Index to some 33,000 10-K filings.\n\nThe Fog Index aims to measure the complexity of a piece of writing as a function of sentence length and the number of \"complex\" words of three or more syllables.\n\nThe index provides an estimate of the number of years of formal education required for a person of average intelligence to read a passage once and understand it. The higher the number, the harder the writing is to understand.\n\nThe mean score for the 10-Ks the researchers looked at was 19.53. Someone who spent that many years in the classroom should have at least a master's degree.\n\nHealthcare and insurance companies had the highest scores (20.22 and 20.16), so it's not just their policies that are hard to understand.\n\nPrecious metals had the lowest score at 18.43. Gold is a one-syllable word.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), known for the chatty shareholder letters of its Chief Executive Warren Buffett, came in at 17.23, making it one of the companies with the highest readability.\n\nStill, that level is well above what most people would consider plain English. Reader's Digest magazine is said to have a Fog score of 8, while the Wall Street Journal's is 12. The story you're reading now, based on a random sample plucked from somewhere in the middle, weighs in at 14.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts take longer to issue their own reports based on hard-to-read 10-Ks -- 10 percent to 15 percent longer on average, the study found -- and their earnings forecasts based on these reports tend to be less accurate than those from more readable ones.\n\nMore surprising, perhaps, is that the less readable a corporate report is, the more influence it appears to have on investors. Analyst forecasts based on 10-Ks in the highest, or least readable, Fog quartile have about 10 percent more influence on investors than those from the lowest, or most readable, quartile, as measured by stock movement on the day of the forecasts.\n\nThe study was published in the May/June issue of the Accounting Review, a journal of the American Accounting Association.\n\nWe welcome comments that advance the story directly or with relevant tangential information.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nGRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: right now, our economy. It's a mess! But you already knew that. Any ideas what to do? Well, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan has an idea. Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is here.\n\nNice to see you, sir. And you have an idea about the tax code.\n\nREP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Absolutely. We've been proposing this all along. As I mentioned before, we've been passing a lot of reforms and ideas from the House to create jobs that are stacking up in the Senate. And one of those things we proposed in our budget was to lower our tax rates on businesses, individuals to no higher than 25 percent, but to pay for that by closing loopholes.\n\nGet rid of the loopholes, lower the tax rates to make us more competitive, so we don't tax our job creators more than our foreign competitors are taxing their companies. That gives us competitiveness, but more importantly, gives businesses certainty, certainty so they know what tax rates are going to be not just today but in the future, so they have more confidence to hire and invest in the future.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, tax is enormously complicated, the whole issue, and we got a sneak peek. You have a video coming out that shows what you want. Tell me what this video -- and when are you going to release it and why are you doing this?\n\nRYAN: We're releasing it tomorrow morning. Basically, it's a complicated issue. Our tax code is extremely complicated. It is so complicated that it is one of the reasons why our economy is not growing well right now. And we do what I call crony capitalism. We pick winners and losers in the tax code through loopholes. Some businesses don't pay a lot of taxes, make good money because they use loopholes. Other businesses play by the rules, pay really high tax rates.\n\nAnd right now, we tax our businesses at much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors tax theirs, and we're losing in global competition. If we want to have a good economy, prosperous America, we need to be competitive on our tax policies. And right now, we're taxing American businesses at rates much higher than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs.\n\nGet rid of the loopholes. Lower tax rates on everybody. Stop picking winners and losers in Washington, and we can start jobs created in this country.\n\nI just did a town hall meeting in Racine County just before I came over here, over the phone, talked to four small business owners who are telling me certainty is the problem. I did all these roundtables with manufacturers in Wisconsin in August. Uncertainty is plaguing them. The key question they ask me is, What's the government going to do to me next? What are my taxes going to be in 2013? What are these new regulations going to do to me?\n\nAnd those are the things that are not being addressed in this new jobs bill the president's sending us, but those are the things that our job creators are telling us they need that kind of certainty so they can actually start planning and investing and having confidence.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, now, the -- one of the sort of the dirty little secrets is that these loopholes, earmarks, or whatever -- is that those -- I mean, they favor somebody.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: And they're there because somebody got to his congressman or senator...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: ... or senator, and got there. And so it -- I mean, there's -- it's all been sort of this -- it's cronyism.\n\nRYAN: I call it crony capitalism.\n\nRYAN: And Republicans and Democrats alike, all of us -- both parties are responsible for this. But what it has done now is it has made our code so complicated, so unfair, and our tax rates so much higher as a result of it.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, one thing that I read that you said -- you said over the last decade, on average, at least one change to the tax code is made every day.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: How can that be? I mean, how can that possibly be?\n\nRYAN: Because Congress passes lots of complicated tax laws, gives a lot of direction to the IRS, who fills up all these tax regulations. And so you have so many new tax enforcement regulations coming out that it is extremely difficult to navigate this tax code.\n\nAnd the other thing is, in the name of interests or whatever, Congress is putting special exceptions in the tax code for certain activities and certain industries. And what that ends up doing is it helps incumbent businesses protect their market share. It erects a barrier to entry against other would-be smaller businesses and in the -- at the same time, in order to raise the revenue for the government, you have to have higher tax rates as a result of it.\n\nSo we're saying get rid of the loopholes, lower everybody's tax rates so that the determiner of whether a business fails or succeeds is not some congressman putting a loophole in but whether or not they're good or not, whether or not they have a good product, whether or not they're innovative or not. That's the kind of thing that we need to spur growth and economic ingenuity in this country.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, there hasn't been much of an overall, I think, since 1986.\n\nRYAN: It's been a while.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Been a while. And it seems that everyone -- everyone agrees that it is so complex. Everyone agrees it's a mess. Everyone agrees that it shows favoritism to certain people. Everyone agrees that it hurts business. So why -- and I can understand there could be debate over, you know, what we actually do or whether we do a \"fair tax,\" flat tax, whatever. But why -- why are we even at this position? I mean, this time -- and what has taken Congress so long? And what is going to take Congress to actually do something? Because it is a problem.\n\nRYAN: And this is the point I keep trying to make, is this should -- this has bipartisan support. There are Democrats, along with the Republicans. who agree with these things we're saying right now.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Yes, Bill Nelson, the Democrat from Florida...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: ... said something today.\n\nRYAN: The President's fiscal commission, Erskine Bowles, the chairman of that, proposed basically doing just this. And so this is what I think we have a shot at working together on a bipartisan basis to fix this situation because both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge this is a problem...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Well, what's the...\n\nRYAN: ... and it ought to be fixed.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: What's the resistance you get? When you talk about it, what's the first thing you hear that -- what's pushback?\n\nRYAN: The industries and the businesses that have their carve-outs in the tax code really care a lot about those carve-outs and fight really hard for these things. And the general public that generally wants a better, fairer, simpler tax system does not fight as fervently for that kind of sense of fairness. So it's really a sense of concentrated special interests at the expense of sort of the greater good. And that's what we have to overcome.\n\nAnd we've got a good bipartisan consensus that this is not the way we should be doing things. And we can get job creation. The fear I have with the president's economic policies (INAUDIBLE) promises all these new tax increases, another stimulus spending, which is basically the last stimulus bill but divided by two, about half as much, with new tax increases on top.\n\nSo it's missing the boat on passing ideas that have proven to work and it's repeating the mistakes of moving ideas that have already proven to fail. And this is an area where a lot of Democrats agree, so I would love to see if we can get the president focused on these kinds of ideas because a lot of people in his party agree with us that this would be good for job growth.", "summary": "Rep.

Not only were there more candidates in 2016, but more of them had well-funded super-PACs. Outside groups have spent at least $360 million in 2016 versus $79 million in 2012, according to a review of filings from the Federal Election Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and Kantar Campaign Media Analysis Group.\n\nTrump, who loaned his campaign the bulk of its funds, eschewed super-PACs and raised less than his last rivals, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nTrump emerged as the presumptive nominee after a victory Tuesday in Indiana. Cruz and Kasich subsequently dropped out of the race.\n\nUnlike in 2012, when the super-PAC Restore Our Future spent more than $41 million to help eventual nominee Mitt Romney fend off primary challenges from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, the biggest spenders in 2016 had little to show for their bottom lines.\n\nRight to Rise USA, the super-PAC that supported the campaign of Jeb Bush, spent the most, $104 million. About $78 million of that was used to promote the former Florida governor, who won just four delegates before suspending his campaign in February after placing fourth in the South Carolina Primary.\n\nConservative Solutions PAC, which supported Bush\u2019s former protege and rival Marco Rubio, a Florida senator, spent about $59 million. Rubio finished third in the delegate count even after dropping out in mid-March after losing his home state to Trump. The quintet of super-PACs backing Cruz spent $44 million.\n\nThrough the end of March, as the field narrowed while he amassed his lead in delegates, Trump\u2019s campaign spent $47 million. Outside groups, led by Our Principles PAC, Club for Growth Action and American Future Fund -- a nonprofit that does not disclose its donors -- combined to spend nearly as much, $43 million, attacking him.\n\nCruz spent the most money among GOP candidates, about $70 million.

Jeb Bush.\n\nInstead of pressuring Bush to move further right toward Cruz's positions on immigration, education and fiscal policy, the entry of the firebrand Texas senator into the 2016 presidential race will do the exact opposite.\n\nCruz's supporters were never going to back Bush, who supports a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and national education standards. But many of them might also support Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee or other more conservative candidates who could get into the GOP presidential race.\n\nCruz does not align exactly with any of these candidates. He is more tea party and less libertarian than Paul. And he is making a big push for evangelical voters. But there is much more overlap than with Bush, who is running in the centrist, Wall Street-friendly establishment lane of the GOP, which in recent cycles has reliably produced the eventual nominee.\n\nWhat first mover Ted Cruz will mean for the race\n\nCruz's entry makes it less likely that any alternative to Bush will come to dominate early in the nominating process. Instead, Cruz, Paul and others will likely split up the hard-right conservative vote in Iowa, giving the eventual winner something less than a clear mandate as the leading non-Bush candidate. Bush would then hope to win New Hampshire, come in at least third in South Carolina and then use his expected vast money advantage to roll up delegates\u2014including in his native Florida\u2014when the race goes national in March.\n\nBush's main concern is not Cruz or Paul\u2014though he will want to maintain viability with social conservatives and libertarians\u2014but rather with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and possibly Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Both Walker and Rubio are making plays for establishment support, and Bush's big fundraising effort is in part designed to lock up that lane before his would-be challengers can get a foothold.\n\nThere is another element to Cruz's candidacy that could work to Bush's advantage.\n\nThe Texas senator in his initial campaign manifesto cited his support for the 2013 shutdown and his hard line in recent debt ceiling fights as a credential in the \"Jobs and Opportunity\" section.\n\nCruz wrote that he \"[d]emanded a 60-vote threshold vote on a clean debt-ceiling increase in February 2013, when Republican leadership wanted to allow the Democrats to raise the limit with a simple majority vote.\" He also \"[i]nsisted on a commitment from Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that the debt ceiling would not be increased as part of a deal to pass the budget.\"", "summary": "Ted Cruz could wind up splitting the anti-Bush vote and giving the former Florida governor clear opportunities, Politico's Ben White says.", "density": 1.0, "coverage": 0.6923076923, "compression": 19.692307692299998, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/science/03brfs-APLANETDENSE_BRF.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2007050319id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/science/03brfs-APLANETDENSE_BRF.html", "title": "A Planet Denser Than Earth", "date": "2007050319", "text": "Despite being the size of Jupiter and made mostly of hydrogen, a planet around a star 440 light-years away is denser than Earth, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., announced.

But the emergence of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev as the chief terror suspects who paralyzed a great American city deserves at least some reflection.\n\nArizona Sen. John McCain on the events surrounding the Boston Marathon bombings. Photo: Getty Images\n\nOne consoling thought is the admirable behavior of the citizens of greater Boston and its law enforcers. The point may seem banal, but it's no small matter that the public largely heeded the government's orders to stay off the streets and take the day off so police could track down the younger brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar, who was captured Friday night after a day-long manhunt.\n\nBostonians have endured enormous disruption this week, but the city has shown a remarkable civility and calm throughout it all. Many lives were saved because of the rapid triage work by volunteers at the bomb scene. Bloomberg News reports that one of the marathon bombing's victims also helped the FBI identify a suspect after he awoke from surgery at the hospital. The suspect had dropped a bag at Jeff Bauman's feet and looked him in the eye minutes before it exploded. Mr. Bauman lost both legs below the knee but got his man.\n\nAs for the brothers, we will learn more about their motives, their training and whether they acted alone or as part of a network. What we have already learned is that they are immigrants from Chechnya, of the Muslim faith, and that 26-year old Tamerlan was uncomfortable in American society despite having lived here for about a decade.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that he was quoted in a Boston University student magazine in 2010 as saying, \"I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them.\" Mother Jones reported that a video attributed to a Tamerlan Tsarnaev extolled an extremist religious prophecy associated with al Qaeda. None of this is definitive but it might be illustrative.\n\nTamerlan Tsarnaev, left, 26, and his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19\n\nIf such alienation turned to jihad, it would not be the first time. The radicalization of young Muslims in the West, in particular children of the well-off, is by now a familiar story. The London bombers of 2005 were middle-class Pakistani immigrants from Birmingham. Faisal Shahzad, the failed Times Square bomber, was a naturalized citizen from Pakistan.\n\nAfter the London bombings, many Americans took comfort in the belief that immigrants to the U.S. are better assimilated than they are in Europe. But that may be more conceit than fact, at least in regard to some young men. \"My Son the Fanatic\" is a novella by Hanif Kureishi that speaks to the difficulties of acculturation of second-generation Muslims. The recent Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \"Disgraced,\" covers related ground.\n\nMitchell Silber and Arvin Bhatt explained how this can evolve into a threat in an instructive paper for the New York Police Department in 2007, \"Radicalization in the West: The Homegrown Threat.\" The intelligence analysts looked at several cases here and abroad and described the process by which otherwise \"unremarkable\" men leading regular lives become jihadists.\n\n\"Muslims in the U.S. are more resistant, but not immune to the radical message,\" they wrote. \"Despite the economic opportunities in the United States, the powerful gravitational pull of individuals' religious roots and identity sometimes supersedes the assimilating nature of American society which includes pursuit of a professional career, financial stability and material comforts.\" The Tsarnaev brothers may be an example.\n\nSome will use this threat as an argument against immigration, but that would punish everyone for the sins of a few. The \"homegrown\" radical threat is really an argument for vigilance, especially within communities prone to producing terrorists.\n\nThis means surveilling foreign student groups in the U.S., certain immigrant communities that have produced jihadists, and, yes, even mosques and other Muslim venues. The key is to be familiar enough with these communities, to know and be trusted enough by their leaders, so those man and women will alert law enforcers when someone appears to have become radicalized.\n\nThis offends some civil libertarians, and the Associated Press excoriated the NYPD for the practice in a series of stories in 2011. In the wake of Boston, this looks notably misguided. New York's police say they've kept at it, under appropriate legal safeguards, and we hope they will continue.\n\nThe U.S. government watches right-wing extremist groups because we know they are dangerous. The police shouldn't refrain from doing the same to Muslim or immigrant groups merely because that is deemed less politically correct. As the week's events in Boston show, the costs of doing otherwise are too high.\n\nA version of this article appeared April 20, 2013, on page A14 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: The Brothers Tsarnaev.", "summary": "The Wall Street Journal on the terrorist suspects next door.", "density": 2.0, "coverage": 0.7272727273, "compression": 86.1818181818, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/casino-mix-up-awards-men-1-million-article-1.1425322", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2013081319id_/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/casino-mix-up-awards-men-1-million-article-1.1425322", "title": "Casino awards two men $1 million prizes after name mix-up", "date": "2013081319", "text": "It pays to be Kevin Lewis - $1 million, exactly.\n\nA Cincinnati casino is shelling out two million-dollar prizes after mistakenly putting a jumbo-sized check in the hands of the wrong man.\n\nIn a highly publicized televised drawing that packed the Horseshoe Casino's floors Saturday night, an announcer boomed out the single winner's name: \"Our next millionaire from Cincinnati is, Kevin Lewis!\"\n\nThe problem was, there wasn't just one Kevin Lewis, but two, and the wrong one was standing in the crowd.\n\nRELATED: WOMAN AWARDED $18.6 MILLION FOR EQUIFAX MIX-UP\n\nThe 52-year-old went nuts, hugging his fianc\u00e9e, giving high fives to the crowd and, once at the front of the stage, was photographed blowing kisses with his arms in the air.\n\n\"When I heard my name I said, 'God finally gave me a big win,'\" he later told WCPO.\n\nWatching back home from his TV set, was the other Kevin Lewis - the drawing's actual winner.\n\nIt wasn't until after the first Lewis was on stage being presented with his massive check that the presenters realized there had been a mistake.\n\nRELATED: OHIO GAMBLER ROBBED OF $35K IN CASH SUES CASINO\n\nDown to the specifics, both men not only have the same name but visit the casino, live in Cincinnati, are in their 50s and are engaged to be married.\n\nCaught in a million-dollar question of ethics with all eyes watching, the casino made the astonishing decision to award both men the same exact prize - all for having the same name.\n\n\"This was our blunder,\" casino general manager Kevin Kline said in a statement. \"So consistent with our commitment to do the right thing for our guests, Horseshoe awarded a $1 million dollar prize to each of the men.\"\n\nThe elated Lewis who was there the night of the drawing, now in addition to his faith in God, blames his luck on \"being at the right place at the right time.\"\n\nRELATED: CATNAP ON A KEYBOARD NEARLY COSTS BANK $293 MILLION\n\nThe Kevin Lewis who did not attend Saturday night's drawing, but who was identified over the phone to the Daily News by his fianc\u00e9e as \"the rightful winner, not to take anything away from the other guy,\" had no comment on his win.\n\nThe casino which opened earlier this year says they're working to make sure the mistake doesn't happen again with one more million-dollar prize scheduled to be awarded on September 1.\n\nOn the casino's Facebook page, the so-called \"class act\" move by the casino was seen praised by both current attendants and promising future ones.\n\n\"What a class act gesture there Saturday,\" one man wrote. \"Any business that does that gets my business!!!!!

In six states, opponents have pushed back against demands that teachers offer lessons about the first craft unions in the 19th century, the large-scale organizing drives that powered the growth of industrial unions in the 1930s, the rise of organized labor as a political machine and other highlights of America's union movement.\n\nCalifornia and Delaware are the only states with laws that encourage schools to teach labor history.\n\nKevin Dayton, a policy consultant to non-union construction companies in California, said the legislation was pushed by unions to boost their ranks.\n\n\"They believe that one of the reasons young people are not organizing in unions is because they're not taught in schools the benefits of being in a collective workforce,\" he said.\n\nEd Leavy, secretary-treasurer of teachers union AFT Connecticut, said the opposite is the case: \"It's not that labor unions are demanding this so we can increase the ranks. It's people preventing this so we don't.\"\n\nThe legislation proposed in Connecticut was benign, Leavy said. It would have helped teachers with resources such as textbooks and instruction guides.\n\nSteve Kass, a member of the executive board of the Greater New Haven Labor History Association and a backer of the legislation, said Connecticut's legislation could have bolstered the union cause.\n\n\"We're losing a generation of workers who don't have an understanding about the union movement,\" he said.\n\nThe measure failed this year for a third consecutive time even after supporters agreed to a compromise to include lessons in the history of capitalism. Opponents had many arguments against the measure.\n\nJoshua Katz, a math teacher at the Oxford Academy in Westbrook, told lawmakers that decisions about curriculum belong to teachers and students, not the legislature.\n\n\"In general, I'm opposed to all of this top-down legislation,\" he said.\n\nThe state's largest business group, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said the legislation would have diverted resources from teaching core curriculum and closing the state's achievement gap.\n\nAnd although backers say the legislation would not have required schools to teach labor history, Robert Labanara, state relations manager at the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said the state Board of Education would have been ordered to help and to encourage school boards to include the history of labor and capitalism in curriculum. That's less benign than it appears, he said.\n\n\"It's not uncommon in Connecticut to see this inch-by-inch law,\" he said. \"It's one thing one year and becomes more of a financial and administrative burden down the road.\"\n\nVarious versions of labor history legislation have failed over the years in Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Legislation also failed calling for labor history and collective bargaining to be taught in Vermont.\n\nThe Connecticut Legislature has already enacted measures requiring the state Board of Education to help and encourage local schools to provide curriculum materials for lessons about the Irish famine, African-American history and Holocaust studies.\n\nSteve Armstrong, president of the National Council for the Social Studies and a West Hartford teacher, says squeezing another course into an already crowded school year could be difficult.\n\n\"It would be great if we can teach six weeks on the Irish potato famine, but it ain't going to happen,\" he said.\n\nTo Leavy, labor history could introduce students to early labor leaders such as Eugene V. Debs in addition to industrialists who are familiar to most Americans.\n\n\"You hear Rockefeller, you hear Vanderbilt,\" he said. \"You don't hear Debs.

Hanks\u2019s Alan Clay is witty and presents himself well, but he\u2019s run down from his long flight, his foreign surroundings, and all that pressure from back at the office. Keep watching, though, and he also starts to seem like the workaday sales force equivalent of some contemporary combat-drama protagonist. Much as he\u2019s striving to accomplish his mission, he\u2019s going slightly mad over there in the desert \u2014 Saudi Arabia, in this case.\n\nIt\u2019s Tom Hanks, so there\u2019s plenty of wry humor in the surreal situations confounding already-spiraling Alan. But there\u2019s also a palpable melancholy to his struggle to find himself again. He couldn\u2019t have picked a worse place to be trying to get his mojo back. Or could he?\n\n\u201cHologram\u201d is adapted by filmmaker Tom Tykwer (co-director of \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d) from a novel by literati fave Dave Eggers, and it feels that way right out of the gate. The movie\u2019s abrupt, breezily cynical opening is a delirious attention-grabber that ranks with Tykwer\u2019s 1999 breakout, \u201cRun Lola Run.\u201d No spoilers here, but who knew Hanks could\u2019ve been CBGB material?\n\nOur takeaway is that Alan is a former big shot for Schwinn whose career and personal life have gone sour, and who\u2019s desperate to sell the Saudi king on some teleconferencing technology he\u2019s now peddling. But this isn\u2019t just one more cinematic case of a savvy Westerner landing in some alien cultural backwater, ostensibly adapting but really just schooling the locals. Alan is the one playing clueless foreigner, as everyone from the king\u2019s inscrutable staffers to Alan\u2019s offbeat hired ride (entertaining American newcomer Alexander Black) seems to know the rules to a game that he\u2019s just not grasping. Picture Alan\u2019s team cooling their heels (or not) in a stifling desert tent next to a gleaming, underoccupied office building. It\u2019s like an international-relations microcosm imagined by the Coen brothers, down to an occasional sense that the absurdity isn\u2019t taking us anywhere.\n\nThen there\u2019s the alarming lump on Alan\u2019s back, which leads him to a quietly liberated female doctor (Sarita Choudhury, \u201cHomeland\u201d). Their tender, empathetic interactions beyond the hospital are ultimately what help most in keeping Hanks\u2019s character, and the movie, from simply wandering the desert.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING\n\nWritten and directed by Tom Tykwer, based on the novel by Dave Eggers.

It was signed by legal representatives for 17 newspaper groups, which collectively publish about 1,200 daily newspapers, including Gannett Co. GCI 1.71 % , the New York Times and Dow Jones, owner of The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to enforce all legal rights to protect our trademarks and copyrighted content and to prevent you from deceiving consumers and unlawfully appropriating our work in the service of your business,\u201d the publishers wrote in the letter.\n\nThe use of ad-blocking tools by consumers has been of increasing concern to publishers and those who rely on revenue from online advertising to support their businesses.\n\nIn a statement, Brave said that the publishers had \u201cfundamentally misunderstood Brave\u201d and that their service \u201cis the solution, not the enemy.\u201d\n\nBrave promises its browser users a faster Web surfing experience by blocking tracking devices and intrusive ads. Users can choose whether to see ads or pay sites directly through a micro-payment system to view content, which Brave said gives \u201cusers and publishers a better deal.\u201d\n\nUsers can also select the ad-replacement mode where they are shown fewer ads, which are sold by Brave and deemed by the company to be safer and faster.

At least to me, the question of whether an author can be held liable (consistent with the First Amendment) for intentionally or unintentionally (but negligently, if proved) ruining an innocent person\u2019s reputation or life, is very interesting \u2026. And in the Breitbart article, it mentions that Barry has hired a lawyer, so legal action may be being contemplated (in the Kevin Williamson piece in National Review \u2026 Barry expresses that this is taking an immense, negative toll on him and his family).\n\nA very interesting question, to which it turns out that there\u2019s a good legal answer (assuming we can figure out the facts).\n\n1. Lena Dunham\u2019s memoir describes her having sex with someone named Barry, whom she labels as Oberlin\u2019s \u201cresident conservative.\u201d Her description seems to me to leave it somewhat ambiguous as to whether Barry raped her, but it does describe some sexual behavior by Barry that at the very least reflects badly on him. There are two passages in which she describes the incident: one in which it comes across as consensual but unsatisfying, and another one that she begins by saying,\n\nBecause I add an invented detail to almost every story I tell about my mother. Because my sister claims every memory we \u201cshare\u201d has been fabricated by me to impress a crowd. Because I get \u201csick\u201d a lot. Because I use the same low \u201cduhhh\u201d voice for every guy I\u2019ve ever known, except for the put-off adult voice I use to imitate my dad. But mostly because in another essay in this book I describe a sexual encounter with a mustachioed campus Republican as the upsetting but educational choice of a girl who was new to sex when, in fact, it didn\u2019t feel like a choice at all.\n\nThe pages that follow, which thus seem to purportedly describe what happened \u201cin fact,\u201d give a good number of details of Barry\u2019s alleged sexual behavior toward her; see the Breitbart News story (John Nolte, Big Hollywood) for some of those details.\n\n2. The Breitbart News story states that there was indeed a well-known conservative student at Oberlin named Barry and that he could easily be identified by people who want to figure out who he is \u2014 and that he has indeed been so identified by many people. (I indeed managed to do this easily myself.) Kevin Williamson (National Review), a prominent critic of Dunham\u2019s, reports the same.\n\nBut the Breitbart News story also alleges that the other details in Dunham\u2019s story, such as Barry\u2019s appearance (e.g., his mustache) and campus job (e.g., his having hosted a radio talk show called \u201cReal Talk With Jimbo\u201d), seem to be inaccurate. And the story alleges that there was no one else named Barry who was a prominent campus conservative. From there, Breitbart News expresses doubts that Dunham actually was involved in such an incident with a conservative named Barry.\n\n3. So those are the facts (item 1, which I can attest to personally, having looked at Dunham\u2019s memoir) and the allegations that Dunham\u2019s account is incorrect (item 2, the substance of which I can\u2019t verify personally). Assuming that the Breitbart allegations are correct, would Dunham\u2019s statements be legally actionable, if Identifiable Conservative Barry sues?\n\nThe answer doesn\u2019t require us to delve into negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress, because this would be a classic defamation case. Identifiable Conservative Barry would argue that\n\nNor does it matter that Barry\u2019s last name was not used. As the Restatement (Second) of Torts says (emphasis and some paragraph breaks added),\n\nA defamatory communication is made concerning the person to whom its recipient correctly, or mistakenly but reasonably, understands that it was intended to refer\u2026.\n\nComment b. Person mistakenly but reasonably believed to be intended. If the communication is reasonably understood by the person to whom it is made as intended to refer to the plaintiff, it is not decisive that the defamer did not intend to refer to him. It is not enough however, that the defamatory matter is actually understood as intended to refer to the plaintiff; the interpretation must be reasonable in the light of all the circumstances. It is not necessary that the plaintiff be designated by name; it is enough that there is such a description of or reference to him that those who hear or read reasonably understand the plaintiff to be the person intended.\u2026\n\nIt is not necessary that everyone recognize the other as the person intended; it is enough that any recipient of the communication reasonably so understands it\u2026.\n\n[T]he defamer is subject to liability if he knew that the communication would be understood by the recipient to refer to the plaintiff or was negligent in failing to recognize that this might happen. If the recipient reasonably understood the communication to be made concerning the plaintiff, it may be inferred that the defamer was negligent in failing to realize that the communication would be so understood\u2026.\n\nTo be sure, if this sort of misunderstanding happens without fault on the speaker\u2019s part, or when it\u2019s unreasonable for people to assume the statement is about the plaintiff, there would be no liability. If I write accurately about something bad done by someone I identify only as Bill, that isn\u2019t a basis for every Bill in the world to sue me, claiming that the statement libels him. I accurately reported the facts, it\u2019s unreasonable for people to assume just based on the name Bill that my statement is about any Bill in particular, and it\u2019s therefore reasonable for me just to call him Bill.\n\nLikewise, if I write an obviously fictional story that mentions someone named Cathy, and even give quite a few details, it\u2019s generally unreasonable for people to assume that this is about any particular Cathy (even one who happens to share the description I offered in my fictional work). At least this is so unless there\u2019s some indication that the reference really isn\u2019t entirely fictional; there\u2019s actually some interesting and controversial case law on facially fictional accounts that are nonetheless seen as implicitly making factual claims.\n\nBut say I write something that on its face seems to be, and is reasonably perceived to be, a factual claim that someone did something bad to me. And say I use a first name coupled with identifying characteristics that would lead reasonable people to perceive that the person is a particular person. People do so reasonably perceive, but it turns out that my account was wrong \u2014 the incident actually involved someone with a different first name, or different identifying characteristics. Unless I made a reasonable mistake, I would be potentially liable for defamation.\n\nAnd that would be the Dunham story, if the Breitbart assertions are correct, and Dunham knew (or at least should have known) that the incident didn\u2019t involve an Oberlin conservative named Barry. To be sure, people who knew Identifiable Conservative Barry very well would realize that her story couldn\u2019t be about him (again, assuming the Breitbart report is right), since he never had the mustache that Dunham described and never worked on the radio show that Dunham mentioned.\n\nBut people who know some details about Identifiable Conservative Barry \u2014 he was named Barry, he was conservative, he was at Oberlin at the same time Dunham was \u2014 whether because they know him personally or because they track him down using those details, would perceive him as the Barry that Dunham was talking about. And the damage to his reputation in those people\u2019s eyes would be sufficient for a libel claim (again, assuming the facts are as Breitbart reports).\n\n4. But there\u2019s one important twist: Any such libel lawsuit is dangerous for plaintiffs in this situation, even if they are entirely innocent. Right now, only a relatively few people link Identifiable Conservative Barry\u2019s name to Dunham\u2019s story, precisely because his last name wasn\u2019t used. If Identifiable Conservative Barry sues, he becomes Identified Conservative Barry, and many more people will link his name to Dunham\u2019s story. Then, even if he prevails in court, or gets Dunham to publish an apology, some people will have learned of the accusation but won\u2019t hear (or remember or believe) the vindication.\n\nThis, for better or worse (or perhaps sometimes for better and sometimes for worse), is one of the costs of libel litigation: It amplifies the original accusation, and sometimes it takes a statement that injured the plaintiff\u2019s reputation only among a few people and turns it into a statement that injured his reputation among many \u2014 again, even if he ultimately \u201cwins\u201d the case. Sometimes a sad reality, but a reality nonetheless.\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019m always delighted to see interesting and substantive comments, of which there are quite a few in the comment thread. But, seriously, enough with the \u201cLena Dunham is so ugly\u201d jokes. Have a little class, and a little originality \u2014 or face the wrath of Sarcastro (who is on a roll, not coincidentally).\n\nEugene Volokh teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law, where he has also often taught copyright law, criminal law, and a seminar on firearms regulation policy.", "summary": "If Dunham's story of sexual misconduct by a conservative \"Barry\" at Oberlin turns out to be incorrect -- or to refer to someone who isn't named Barry -- can the actual conservative Barry sue?", "density": 1.3076923077, "coverage": 0.7948717949, "compression": 48.615384615400004, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/world/africa/jubilant-fighters-return-to-benghazi-the-cradle-of-libyas-revolt.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2011102319id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/world/africa/jubilant-fighters-return-to-benghazi-the-cradle-of-libyas-revolt.html", "title": "Jubilant Fighters Return to Benghazi, the Cradle of Libya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Revolt", "date": "2011102319", "text": "Joao Pina for The New York Times\n\nLibyans welcome returning anti-Qaddafi fighters to Benghazi on Saturday.

It's a contrast from his first year in office, when he touched down in every major region of the world.\n\nThe president's three-day trip to Canada that begins today will give him the chance to meet face-to-face with many of the foreign leaders he's only dealt with by phone in recent months.\n\nIn a 30-hour span, Obama is scheduled to meet privately with new British Prime Minister David Cameron; South Korean President Lee Myung Bak; Chinese President Hu Jintao; Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh; and new Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan.\n\nThe White House says its emphasis on Asian and Pacific nations is intended to send a message that the U.S. recognizes the region's rising influence in world affairs and the ability of the United States to be a stabilizing force.\n\nSome examples: U.S. support for South Korea's decision to cut off trade and investment with North Korea following a torpedo attack on its warship that killed 46 sailors, as well as last month's decision to keep a contentious U.S. Marine base on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.\n\n\"The nexus of power in the world is moving to Asia in ways that were unthinkable just 10 years ago,\" says Evan Feigenbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations, a former Asia expert at the State Department. \"They're carrying the growth story of the global economy on their back.\"\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey shows strong majorities in Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea have confidence that Obama will do the right thing in world affairs. Obama fares best, however, in Western Europe.\n\nChina and India have led the recovery from the global recession with growth rates in the 9%-10% range this year, far surpassing the United States and Europe. In hopes of seeing other countries rebound, Asian leaders are likely to side with Obama against Europe in seeking only a slow turn toward austerity measures.\n\n\"What Obama's trying to do is court the Asians. The Asians actually have a subtle difference of view with Europe,\" says Eswar Prasad, an expert on international economics at the Brookings Institution. \"On the economic and political fronts, Asia is where the action is right now.\"\n\nObama plans to go to Seoul in November for the next G-20 meeting. He'll also stop in India and Japan.\n\nObama's first head-to-head meeting Saturday in Toronto \u2014 and the only one set so far with a European leader \u2014 will be with Britain's newly elected prime minister. Cameron wants assurances that British oil giant BP will survive the Gulf crisis, and his nation is increasingly anxious about the war in Afghanistan, which claimed four more British troops Thursday.\n\n\"This is definitely a high-stakes, high-stress environment to be establishing a relationship,\" says Heather Conley, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nDifferences will emerge on the global economy as well. Cameron's government is seeking tough spending cuts and tax increases, while Obama still favors additional stimulus measures.\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

I can tell you this...\n\nFolks of today are trying (i.e.,\"trying\") to be so \"civilized\" and \"sophisticated\" and \"PC\" (as if the OLD TIME WAY of doing things were so tactless that we must \"progress\" away from those old-school teachings and qualities) but NEW SCHOOL MINDSET only lends itself to more moral decay, debauchery and denigration.\n\nBULLIES in my time ONLY BULLIED for a \"short amount of time\" until they got their butts dusted and that was the end of that! We have to STOP teaching kids to be so SCARY, GOD GAVE YOU NAILS, FISTS FOR A REASON.\n\nSelf-defense is a positive, not a negative. And, that is the ONLY way to truly overcome bullying... You have to TEACH KIDS how to SAFELY DEFEND themselves.\n\nNo, no... I'm not talking about a kid grabbing a razor or gun, but good techniques on how to render a bully defenseless, how to knock him square on his duff!!!\n\nEvery school should have a SELF-DEFENSE CLASS and that in of itself will teach a bully DON'T MESS AROUND. BULLIES are PUNKS!\n\nThey are LOW SELF-ESTEEMED indiviuals and SCARY themselves. That's why the \"bullying\" and \"scare tactics\" they administer is ONLY a COVER UP for their inadquacies, short-comings and fears. One good pop... BOOM!\n\nAnd, I promise you is the CURE ALL for a bully situation. How do I know?\n\nBecause I was bullied as a kid, but that was ONLY until I found the courage and my dad showed me how to take courage in DEFENDING MYSELF and as soon as that bully stepped to me I delivered one helluva \"BOP!\"\n\nThat was the end of my being bullied and even the end of my classmates being bullied - this kid had all of us terrorized!\n\nBut, it took just ONE OF US to put the dukes on! And, that was the end of his days of bullying - this kid became the JOKE of the school and the most humbled (humiliated) kid in our class!\n\nLET'S STOP TEACHING OUR KIDS TO BE SCARY. LET'S STOP BREEDING THE \"VICTIM\" MINDSET IN OUR KIDS!\n\nLET'S TEACH THEM SELF-DEFENSE, SELF-CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE.\n\nThese are the TOOLS to defeat any bully, any where at any time - even ADULT bullies can not withstand these amazing Self-Empowering Tools!\n\nPosted by: LPATWILLFILM | October 18, 2010 10:28 AM | Report abuse\n\nI have three older brothers, as a girl of around 8 yrs old I found myself the target of a neighborhood \"female\" bully. At the very sight of this girl, my feet took flight to the safety of home.....with the bully and her followers in hot pursuit. This went on until my oldest brother TOLD me that I had to face her down, or \"else\". My brother ordered me back out the door...yup, she was still there. Driven by fear and pumped with adrenalin, I proceded to WAX her. My brother later explained: \" Get the one with the biggest mouth and the rest will fall back\". It worked. Unfortunatly, we live in an ego driven society, no more whip the bully - bully backs off. Nope - bully returns with weapon.\n\nPosted by: walonika | October 18, 2010 11:11 AM | Report abuse\n\nWell, fighting the bully off only works when it's a fair fight and you win. I did it once - I wouldn't call it a win either, more of a draw - and after that the bullies hunted in packs. It's a little hard to fight off a half-dozen girls when it's just you. Besides, girl bullies tend not to use physical force as much as social ostracization, harassment, etc. If you answer that with force, then YOU are the one who gets in trouble because you are the one who took it to the next level. So, LPATWILLFILM, your advice is half-right. Sometimes that is the solution. Sometimes it just makes it worse or doesn't change a thing.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, I have to give Beiber credit here for standing up for himself. And if was just a little schoolyard pushing, then there's no need to get the authorities involved.\n\nPosted by: DCCubefarm | October 18, 2010 11:47 AM | Report abuse\n\n>That 12-year-old must have great parents.

When you dealt with bullies, you would see them at school and then come home. Or maybe, there was a bully on your block but when you were in the safety of your home, it stopped. Now, children are being bullied in school, harassed on their way home, AND harassed at home through the internet. They will call you a fag to your face, then send a text message to the whole school that you are a fag so all those people will laugh/demean you, and then when you get home, they will flood your facebook/twitter/myspace with the word. They can do it anonymously so you don't even know who is responsible. You don't know who to face.\n\nAnd while the kid may know how to defend himself or herself without a weapons, who is not to say that the bully will not come back the next day with a knife, or worse a gun, to retaliate. Most bullies are all talk though. Unfortunately, with the level of technology available today, its easy to bully someone. Its easy to degrade them and belittle them so that everyone else knows. Its as simple as pressing a button. And its permanent.\n\nThe Rutgers student killed himself because he realized that the internet is permanent. Future employers could do a search for him on the internet and BAM, the most humiliating and invasive moment of his life can be found and re-watched. Have you seen how many fights are posted on Youtube? Could you imagine being beat up and then going home and seeing the beating on the internet? Could you imagine seeing this fight get hits daily as people continue to relive this humiliating moment in your life.\n\nThese kids need a thicker skin, but you have to remember that times have definitely changed things for the worse.\n\nPosted by: fizzchizz | October 18, 2010 12:16 PM | Report abuse\n\nThe comments to this entry are closed.", "summary": "...", "density": 1.0, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 1684.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/30/4-weird-reasons-youre-gaining-weight.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015103019id_/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/30/4-weird-reasons-youre-gaining-weight.html", "title": "4 weird reasons you\u2019re gaining weight", "date": "2015103019", "text": "Yes, the most likely culprits behind extra weight gain include your couch and the snack shelf. But some new studies suggest there are less obvious factors that could lead to mid-section spread. Here are four subtle and weird ways you could be adding pounds\u2014and how to stop it.\n\n1. Couple trouble Want a compelling reason to immediately resolve your marital woes? Letting your fights get too hot might make you more susceptible to weight gain. A recent study found that couples whose arguments were tinged with hostility had higher levels of a hunger hormone\u2014and were more likely to make poor food choices\u2014than couples who were kinder to each other.\n\nResearchers at the University of Delaware tracked hormone levels in 43 couples as they ate a meal and then discussed their differences. Observers rated the discussions\u2014which often boiled into arguments\u2014on the use of hostile language. Couples who ranked high in the use of hostile language also had the highest circulating levels of ghrelin, a hunger-related hormone that encourages eating. When the researchers asked the couples to fill out food surveys, hostile couples were more likely to report eating foods high in sodium and unhealthy fats compared to those whose interactions were more civil.\n\n\"The findings suggest marital distress may be an important risk factor for weight gain,\" said study author Lisa Jaremka, PhD, assistant professor at the University of Delaware, though she is quick to add that the effect was missing in people already overweight. In other words, don't wait too long to get couples counseling. (Lose up to 15 pounds WITHOUT dieting with Eat Clean to Get Lean, a 21-day clean-eating meal plan.)\n\n2. Overdoing it on iron If you were thinking about cutting back on red meat to help control calories, here's one more reason that could be a sound plan: A new study suggests the amount of iron in red meat might alter hunger hormones in your body, slowing metabolism and encouraging you to eat more.\n\nDonald McClain, director of the Center on Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism at Wake Forest School of Medicine fed mice diets that contained high or low levels of iron while tracking their levels of leptin, an appetite-suppressing hormone. After two months, McClain discovered that leptin levels had dropped by as much as 42 percent in the high-iron mice. To test whether low leptin led to over-eating, he let both groups of mice eat as much as they wanted: Sure enough, the high-iron group downed more calories than mice on the low-iron diet. Finally, McClain checked iron and leptin levels in 76 people and discovered that the higher their iron, the lower their leptin levels were. People with the highest iron had one-third the leptin of those with the lowest amounts of iron. (Everyone's iron levels fell within the normal range.)\n\nMcClain's findings suggest iron recommendations\u201418 mg a day for women 18 to 50 and 8 mg a day for women 51 and older\u2014may be too high, he says. Eating more than a pound of red meat per week could be enough to raise leptin to levels he observed in his research, warned McClain. Unless your doctor says otherwise, you'll want to limit the amount of iron you get from meat and supplements, McClain said. But don't be too concerned about iron sources such as nuts, beans, spinach, tomatoes: You don't absorb as much from these food sources as you do from red meat.\n\nMORE: 15 Teeny Tiny Changes To Lose Weight Faster\n\n3. Blaming your DNA Some day, science may be able to link certain genes to a tendency to gain weight\u2014but we're not there yet. And a recent study suggests that believing weight problems are genetic practically guarantees you'll pack on the pounds.\n\nTapping into a survey of nearly 9,000 women and men, Michael C. Parent, PhD, assistant professor in the department of psychological sciences at Texas Tech University and colleagues analyzed the people's beliefs regarding the genetics of being fat. When Parent followed up three years later, he discovered that the more strongly people believed genetics played a significant role in fatness, the more likely they were to have gained weight. This group was also less likely to exercise and eat right.\n\nMind is definitely influencing matter here, since Parent's findings also revealed that people who believed their weight was under their control were more likely to eat well, exercise regularly, and have a lower BMI.\n\n\"There is no direct genetic cause for obesity,\" Parent said.\n\nHe recommends you avoid playing the genetic blame game; instead, embrace the idea that you are in control of your weight.\n\nMORE: 25 Best Diet Tips Of All Time\n\n4. It's just harder than it used to be This is truly frustrating news: Recent findings published in Obesity Research & Clinical Practice indicate that we're getting fatter on fewer calories than our parents did. Although we're eating about the same amount of food\u2014and we're equally active\u2014the current generation is gaining more weight than people did 40 years ago.\n\nThe researchers analyzed info on more than 36,000 people between 1971 and 2008, comparing diet, activity, and weight. Study author Jennifer Kuk, professor of health and sciences at York University in Toronto found that given the same amount of calories, an adult in 2008 is about 10 percent heavier than she would be in 1971.\n\n\"Again, we're finding that weight management is much more complex than just energy in versus energy out,\" Kuk said.\n\nThe solution isn't complex, however: We all have exercise more and be more careful about what we eat.

What kind of premium would you have to pay to obtain a portfolio managed by him? For the Pimco High Income Fund, a $1 billion closed-end he manages, the answer is 44%. That figure says a lot about how befuddled investors can be.\n\nThis guy's talents are worth a handsome fee, to be sure. (The Web page for the fund informs us, accurately, that Gross \"is widely regarded as the world's foremost fixed-income authority.\") But his management fee is already built into the operating cost of this fund. The premium is something else. The fund has a fixed supply of shares outstanding, and demand is so great that people wanting in have to pay $1.44 for each dollar of assets they get.\n\nI cite this particular insanity as a footnote to Neil Weinberg's story (\"The Way to Win on Wall Street Now\") on investing. His point: If you are looking for someone to blame for Wall Street's excesses, look in the mirror. In this case the company that controls the fund, the German insurer Allianz ( AZ - news - people ), is a mostly innocent party. The 44-cent cover charge you pay to get into this exclusive club goes not to Allianz but to one of the departing guests--who should be saying, on his way out the door, \"I am so happy the world has greater fools than me.\"\n\nWhy are people paying the premium? Three reasons, all dumb.\n\nThe first is last year's results. In the fund's Mar. 31, 2010 fiscal year it delivered a 215% return, as junk bonds recovered from their depression lows. So what? You can't buy past performance.\n\nNext reason: leverage. This fund borrows money at slim short-term rates to buy risky assets paying fat long-term coupons. Roughly speaking, it has $1.60 at work for every dollar belonging to common shareholders. Margin buying is a great idea in a bull market. In a bear market, not a great idea. Whatever your taste for such stimulus, you shouldn't be paying a premium for access to it.\n\nYou might be thinking, \"Pimco can borrow at rates close to 0%. I can't.\" But maybe you can. Any cash in your brokerage account is yielding 0%. Use it. Instead of buying $10,000 of a levered fund, put $16,000 to work in an unlevered fund.\n\nThird reason: yield. Pimco High's payout (as a percent of net assets) is a dazzling 17.7%, a reflection not only of what leverage does to junk coupons but also of the fund's habit of throwing some principal into the monthly dividend check. I've got bad news for yield junkies: In a premium-priced fund, yield is poison. Whatever dividend dollars come in the mail are dollars for which you just paid $1.44 each. You'd be better off if the fund didn't pay any dividends.\n\nSpecial Offer: Free Trial Issue of Forbes", "summary": "Getting high on fund yields.", "density": 0.6666666667000001, "coverage": 0.6666666667000001, "compression": 100.3333333333, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://mashable.com/2011/09/09/facebook-third-party-apps-study/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2011091119id_/http://mashable.com/2011/09/09/facebook-third-party-apps-study/", "title": "Facebook Fail: Posting via Other Apps Can Cut Likes & Comments by 88% [STUDY]", "date": "2011091119", "text": "Does posting to Facebook via third-party apps make any difference to how engaged your fans are? Does Facebook\u2019s algorithm discriminate against content management apps?\n\nThe people at Applum, creators of Edgerank Checker, decided to find out. They analyzed more than a million Facebook updates on more than 50,000 Pages in order to test the theory that posting to Facebook via third-party apps simply doesn\u2019t generate as much engagement as posting directly on Facebook.\n\nThe results were surprising. Applum found that posting via one of the top ten third-party APIs gave you an average of 88% fewer comments and likes, compared to posting directly to Facebook yourself.\n\nApplum\u2019s speculative reason: Facebook penalizes third-party apps in its complex algorithm. Indeed, Facebook updates from some third-party apps are condensed into a single News Feed story. This effectively eliminates opportunities for the kind of impressions and engagement you would get on separate posts.\n\nFacebook users can decide to block all updates from any third-party app, which could also be a factor.\n\nHowever, Applum notes, it may also be the type of content that is being posted through these apps \u2014 and its timing that is causing the problem. Many posts in third-party apps are scheduled or automated, which can lead to weaker engagement. Content from third-party apps is often not optimized for Facebook. For example, Twitter posts don\u2019t usually include links with descriptions and thumbnails.\n\nSo is Facebook deliberately downgrading third-party apps? \u201cWe\u2019re focused on ensuring that users see the highest quality stories in News Feed,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told us. \u201cAs part of this, related stories are typically aggregated so users can see a consolidated view of stories from one app. In some cases, we work closely with trusted partners, such as Preferred Developer Consultants, to test new ways of surfacing stories, and gather feedback to improve the Platform experience.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: An earlier version of the Edgerank Checker post, and of this article, broke out figures for two third-party content management apps: Hootsuite and Tweetdeck.

He said the company had no further comment.\n\nThe fire was brought under control about three hours after it began. Some 85 firefighters had to be called in from several jurisdictions. Davies said because there was no fire hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled water tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier near the property to bring in water.\n\nBecause of the intensity of the fire, the size of the house and the failure of the roof and floors, firefighters have been unable to search the structure after it was reduced to its stone framework, Davies said. He added that hot spots took another 10 hours to extinguish before operations were scaled back around nightfall. A fire engine company and police planned to remain on the site overnight.\n\nAgents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were on the premises on Monday afternoon.

He said the team was expected to arrive on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a 2008 story in the Baltimore Sun, the Pyles\u2019s house, which was the site of a charity event, was described as looking like a castle, with mini-turrets, stonework and lion statues.\n\nState property records said the two-story house was built in 2005, then listed at $4.2 million.", "summary": "The six people remain unaccounted for but structure is unstable and water needs to be pumped from basement before search can begin", "density": 1.4090909091000001, "coverage": 0.8636363636000001, "compression": 32.1818181818, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/03/21/samuel-l-jackson-and-charles-barkley-star-in-hilarious-new-ad/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015032119id_/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/03/21/samuel-l-jackson-and-charles-barkley-star-in-hilarious-new-ad/", "title": "Samuel L.

Thirteen more times.\n\nFortunately, I am here to watch these things if you don't want to. It's not that they're unworthy. There are nuggets, like this one Tuesday night:\n\nRICK PERRY, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Romneycare has driven the cost of small business insurance premiums up by 14 percent over the national average in Massachusetts. So my question for you would be: How would you respond to his criticism of your signature legislative achievement?\n\nMITT ROMNEY, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm proud of the fact that we took on a major problem in my state. I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish. I will tell you this though: We have the lowest number of kids as a percentage uninsured of any state in America. You have the highest.\n\nThat back and forth was instructive and challenging, forcing the potential voter to take a side.\n\nBut the real GOP headline on Tuesday was Chris Christie endorsing Mitt Romney. That's huge for the former Massachusetts governor. Christie's support sends a signal to conservative Americans that it's OK to like Romney, who is suspect in many right-wing circles and is being challenged on the right flank by Herman Cain.\n\nThe reason Christie endorsed Romney is because the Republican Party knows independent voters are much more likely to vote for Romney than for Cain, and independent voters will decide the general election. According to a new Pew poll, independents now favor Romney over Obama 54 to 41.\n\nThe Republican Party desperately wants to not only win the White House but the Senate as well, thereby totally controlling the agenda in Washington. If that happens next year, say goodbye to Obamacare. It will be repealed faster than the Boston Red Sox fell apart last month. Also, taxes will be lowered, federal spending will be cut, and Nancy Pelosi will be distraught and confused.\n\nThat's the scenario the Republican establishment wants, and they believe Romney is their best hope for attaining it.\n\nAs you may remember, Rhode Island businessman Marc Perlman was the high bidder for our Wounded Warrior auction. Marc spent $60,000 for the unique historical poster signed by the five living American presidents. But Marc didn't stop there. His company, Ocean State Job Lot, raised an additional $140,000 for the Warriors.\n\nOn top of that, \"Factor\" viewers bought facsimiles of the presidential document for another $200,000.

Alejandro Garcia Padilla's spokesman, Jesus Manuel Ortiz, confirmed that the island's government is seeking to defer payments while negotiating with creditors.\n\nHe confirmed comments by Garcia that appeared in a report in The New York Times published late Sunday, less than a day before Garcia is scheduled to deliver a public address amid debate on a $9.8 billion budget that calls for $674 million in cuts and sets aside $1.5 billion to help pay off the debt. The budget has to be approved by Tuesday.\n\n\"There is no other option. I would love to have an easier option. This is not politics, this is math,\" Garcia is quoted as saying in the Times.\n\nThe island's debt figure is four times that of Detroit, according to the Washington Post.\n\nPuerto Rico's bonds were popular with U.S. mutual funds because they were tax-free, but hedge funds and distressed-debt buyers have been stepping in to buy up the debt as the island's economy worsened and its credit rating dropped.\n\nPuerto Rico's constitution dictates that the debt has to be paid before any other financial obligation is met. If Garcia seeks to not pay the debt at all, it will require a referendum and a vote on a constitutional amendment, said Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez, spokeswoman for the main opposition party.\n\nShe said in a phone interview that she was taken aback by Garcia's comments, which came out just hours before he was scheduled to meet with legislators.\n\n\"I think it's irresponsible,\" Gonzalez said. \"He met privately with The New York Times last week, but he hasn't met with the leaders of this island.\"\n\nPuerto Rico's central government could run out of cash as soon as July, possibly leading to a government shutdown, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be painful for the next two to three years,\u201d Rep. Pedro Pierluisi, D-Puerto Rico, told the paper. Pierluisi, the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, is the island's non-voting representative to the U.S. House.\n\nPuerto Rico's situation has drawn comparisons to Greece, where the government decreed this weekend that banks would be shuttered for six business days and restrictions imposed on cash withdrawals. The country's five-year financial crisis has sparked questions about its continued membership in the 19-nation shared euro currency and the European Union.\n\nPuerto Rico's governor recently confirmed that he had considered having his government seek permission from the U.S. Congress to declare bankruptcy amid a nearly decade-long economic slump. His administration is currently pushing for the right for Puerto Rico's public agencies to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9. Neither the agencies nor the island's government can file for bankruptcy under current U.S. rules.\n\nPuerto Rico's public agencies owe a large portion of the debt, with the power company alone owing some $9 billion. The company is facing a restructuring as the government continues to negotiate with creditors as the deadline for a roughly $400 million payment nears.\n\nGarcia has taken several measures to help generate more government revenue, including signing legislation raising the sales tax to 11.5 percent and creating a 4 percent tax on professional services. The sales tax increase goes into effect Wednesday and the new services tax on Oct. 1, to be followed by a transition to a value-added tax by April 1.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "summary": "Puerto Rico's governor believes the U.S. territory's $72 billion public debt is unpayable, a spokesman confirmed late Sunday, adding another blow to a world financial system already struggling with a possible default by Greece.", "density": 3.0, "coverage": 0.75, "compression": 17.8, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2013/07/24/googles-chromecast-a-brilliant-play-for-the-living-room-especially-with-35-price-tag/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2013072419id_/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2013/07/24/googles-chromecast-a-brilliant-play-for-the-living-room-especially-with-35-price-tag/", "title": "Google's Chromecast A Brilliant Play For The Living Room -- Especially With $35 Price Tag", "date": "2013072419", "text": "Google's Chromecast device | Image credit: Google\n\nGoogle Google is taking another stab at being the center of your living room, and this time they\u2019ve opted for an affordable, platform-agnostic device called Chromecast.\n\nEssentially Chromecast is a 2-inch HDMI dongle running a stripped down version of Google\u2019s Chrome OS. A user plugs it into any HDMI-equipped television or monitor, connects it to their home Wireless network, and enjoys the ability to stream content like Netflix Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Music, or open Chrome tabs to their HDTV with the press of a button on their device.\n\nThe appeal should extend beyond the aggressive $35 price tag. At a press event earlier today hosted by Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s Senior Vice President of Android and Chrome Apps, the company emphasized the importance of not having to learn anything new. No additional menus, no unfamiliar user interfaces. Chromecast is controlled by software you already use on a daily basis.\n\nTo illustrate its functionality, imagine you\u2019re lounging on the couch watching House of Cards via Netflix on your Nexus 7 \u2014 or any Android tablet or phone. Press the new \u201ccast\u201d button on Netflix, and the show gets \u201cbeamed\u201d to your television, by signaling to the Chromecast to pull that content down from the internet.\n\nAt that point, the device becomes a remote control, but also retains its full functionality. In other words, feel free to check your email, join a Google Hangout, or jump on Twitter while enjoying the content on your TV.\n\nHere\u2019s where Google made a wise decision: Chromecast is app-driven, not device-driven. This means it will work with your iPad, iPhone, Mac, all Android phones and tablets, even your desktop computer. (Blackberry and Windows Phone weren\u2019t given a nod, however.) Even more brilliant is that the play state of your content \u2014 whether it\u2019s a simple MP3 or a rented movie \u2014 syncs across all these devices, allowing you to pick up and play where left off.\n\nWith a myriad of more expensive retail devices promising to turn your \u201cdumb\u201d TV into a Smart TV, as well as proprietary devices like the Roku Streaming Stick, Google has taken a brilliant path by augmenting devices we already own, without playing favorites and without catering to one ecosystem over another. It even has baked in support for multiple users.\n\nGoogle also announced an SDK available for developers to add Chromecast support to existing apps. Like Chrome OS, the Chromecast will auto update ensuring those apps are supported as soon as the functionality is available.\n\nIt remains to be seen if consumers will latch on to Chromecast, but at $35 it borders on an impulse purchase \u2014 and 3 months of Netflix only sweetens the deal. It could even be disruptive to Microsoft Microsoft, whose Xbox One is designed around uniting devices in your living room.\n\nUPDATE: Chromecast is now available on Amazon.com (with free shipping for Prime members) and on Google Play.", "summary": "Google is taking another stab at being the center of your living room, and this time they've opted for an affordable, platform-agnostic device called Chromecast.", "density": 15.0967741935, "coverage": 0.9677419355, "compression": 18.8387096774, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.people.com/article/Dave-Barry-new-book-best-state-ever-florida-man", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160921190500id_/http://www.people.com/article/Dave-Barry-new-book-best-state-ever-florida-man", "title": "'Best.

Here are five things Barry learned in his Florida travels that taught him: \"Even our boring parts are exciting.\"\n\nBarry travels to the murky Everglades to meet Dave Shealy, a former drug smuggler turned skunk ape enthusiast. Shealy founded Skunk-Ape Research Headquarters because he claims to have seen a skunk ape three times. (For the uninformed: a skunk ape \"is Florida's version of Bigfoot.\" According to legend, it walks like a man, is covered in dark hair, is seven feet tall and smells like bad eggs. \"It is said to like lima beans,\" Barry adds.) Though Barry doesn't see any skunk apes on his expedition with Shealy, the skunk ape expert shares stories about previous alleged sightings.\n\nBarry travels to Cassadaga, Florida, \"The Psychic Capital of the World,\" and gives a psychic a picture of his dog, Lucy. The psychic observes that Lucy is smart, spiritual, loving, passionate and energetic.\n\n\"In short,\" writes Barry, \"to summarize what Lucy's aura reveals, as seen by a professional in the psychic field:\n\nBarry quickly learned that when the folks at The Villages aren't riding their golf carts or drinking $5 wine out of cups, they're dancing. He writes, \"There are three main types of White Person dancers\": freestyle disco, couples from dance classes, and line dancers. And most of them wear serious expressions like they're \"installing drapes.\"\n\nBarry's favorite dancer of the night? A retired lieutenant colonel of the United States Air Force who beautifully melds karate and Elvis-style dance moves. The ladies love him \u2013 especially his suspenders.\n\n\"Women love them,\" says the retired lieutenant. \"I've had them unhook 'em.\"\n\nBarry goes to the shooting range Lock & Load Miami with his buddy, Ron Ungerman, for the \"Machine Gun Experience.\" Barry picks the $209 Special Forces package and Ungerman selects the $179 Scarface package. Barry adds a Glock to the mix because of the Fetty Wap song. \"I will never own a 'rari, but I'm thinking it might be fun to say I actually fired a Glock,\" writes Barry.\n\nWhen the guys are done shooting their respective machine guns, Barry writes, they're \"both totally wired, like squirrels on speed. We are giddy and euphoric. We agree that the Machine Gun Experience is one of the most fun and exciting things we have ever done...\"\n\nBarry and his friend go bar hopping on bicycles. They see drag performers, visit a strip club owned by the city commissioner, and end up at a clothing-optional bar. Barry and his buddy see two male \"saggy old exhibitionists\" with their legs spread open.

Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/Rex\n\nWinning ugly is not really Roberto Mart\u00ednez's thing but his Everton players made a decent fist of grinding out a strictly no-frills victory that promises to help propel them on to the Champions League stage.\n\nSecured courtesy of Wes Brown's own goal, this was far from the fluent, beautifully crafted triumph generally synonymous with Mart\u00ednez's side but its importance should not be underestimated.\n\nUp to fourth place, two points clear of Arsenal, a huge prize is now within Everton's grasp. Their manager was congratulated with the warmest of embraces from his old friend and former Real Zaragoza team-mate Gus Poyet at the final whistle as the Uruguayan put a brave face on a narrow defeat that all but rubber-stamps Sunderland's relegation.\n\n\"A bit of a contrast to some of our other games,\" said Mart\u00ednez. \"Very tense, very cagey, but really satisfying. With three points so significant for both teams I was always worried, but we defended very well. We didn't create too much, just three chances, so I'm pleased we took one.\"\n\nAlthough it went down as Brown's own goal \u2013 Sunderland's sixth in the League \u2013 it was appropriate that he turned in a delivery from Gerard Deulofeu. The young winger, borrowed from Barcelona, was the one individual who stood out from the crowd, the only player to provoke a frisson every time he received possession. \"It was the sort of game that needed a bit of magic and Gerard contributed it,\" said Mart\u00ednez. \"He was a real threat; the difference between 1-0 and a scrappy 0-0.\"\n\nAfter acknowledging his bottom-placed side required \"a miracle\" to survive, Poyet had pledged to \"go back to basics\" and he did not disappoint. Sure enough, he abandoned his recent experiment with a back five, reverted to 4-1-4-1, recalled Jack Colback to central midfield and even swapped his matchday suit for a tracksuit.\n\nIt produced a much improved performance only lacking a touch of Deulofeu-esque invention and incision. \"We competed and we were very close to Everton but it wasn't enough. It was the story of our season,\" said Poyet. \"Something always goes wrong. It's difficult to take. It hurts. We still have a chance of staying up but we're running out of games.\"\n\nAs well as Sunderland played at times, Tim Howard, Everton's goalkeeper, was hardly overstretched while Everton's first two chances \u2013 both spurned by Steven Naismith \u2013 were highly inviting and of the variety rarely missed by the visiting midfielder.\n\nBrown certainly had no answers when Naismith connected with a Leighton Baines pass before seamlessly turning him and then shooting, wastefully, over the bar.\n\nThe increasing ferocity with which Mart\u00ednez chewed gum as he stood, arms folded, in his technical area, confirmed that Everton were not having things quite all their own way. By half-time John Stones had cleared off the line from Fabio Borini and Connor Wickham's excellent hold-up play was offering Poyet reasons for cautious optimism.\n\nIn naming Kevin Mirallas and Ross Barkley as substitutes the visiting manager had taken quite a gamble and early in the second half he liberated the latter from the bench.\n\nShortly afterwards Mannone fluffed an attempted headed clearance and the ball dropped conveniently for Naismith who, uncharacteristically, sent his volley swerving wide.

Intentionally or not, director Rob Cohen (\u201cAlex Cross\u201d) has put together the most hilarious camp classic since \u201cWhite House Down\u201d (2013).\n\n\u201cThe Boy Next Door\u201d also teaches a lesson. Not that a married woman (OK, she\u2019s been separated for nine months) sleeping with a 19-year-old stud deserves whatever she gets. Everybody knows that. More important, it teaches the pernicious effect that Greek literature has on a young person\u2019s behavior. Forget violent video games \u2014 have you read the \u201cIliad\u201d?\n\nNoah (Ryan Guzman) has. He\u2019s the boy next door. He appears out of nowhere, his brawny arm jutting into the frame to help Lopez\u2019s Claire open a balky garage door. When he learns that Claire teaches \u201cthe classics\u201d at the local high school, he wants to sign up. \u201cHomer is my favorite!\u201d he says. \u201cAchilles is a total badass!\u201d\n\nHe befriends Kevin (Ian Nelson), Claire\u2019s noodle of a son, teaching him how to pick up girls, repair an alternator, throw a punch, and shoot a .45. He warns him not to believe the lies of his adulterous father, Garrett (John Corbett), when dad tries to wheedle back into the family. Claire, meanwhile, has taken to looking at Noah at night when stands by the window and takes his shirt off. . .\n\nWell, nine months is a long time. And Noah is persistent. Everybody makes mistakes, right? Like her husband. But when she tries to let Noah off easy, she awakens the wrath of Achilles.\n\nThat\u2019s 20 minutes into the film. For over an hour Noah just gets crazier and crazier, stalking Claire, hacking her computer, turning her son against her, fracturing somebody\u2019s skull, assaulting the assistant principal. In his mind, he believes that he\u2019s a hero \u2014 not like Garrett, an old fart who cheats on a beautiful woman like Claire. A woman Noah adores. Whom he will never leave.\n\nYou\u2019d think at some point they\u2019d call the police. Or do a Google search on the kid. Find out why he is 19 and still in high school and what really happened to his parents. They might find out that he is what they call in the psychology business a crazy person. A narcissist with lethal martial arts skills. In possession of handguns. A walking, oedipal time bomb.\n\nAh yes, \u201cOedipus the King,\u201d another of Noah\u2019s favorites. He writes a quote from the play in giant letters on the blackboard after he has decorated Claire\u2019s classroom with hundreds of Xeroxed copies of pictures he secretly took while they engaged in their extracurricular activities.\n\nKeep Oedipus in mind [SPOILERS!] when this tragi-comedy reaches its catastrophe in a stable full of sharp metal objects, ropes, and a can of gasoline.

And as I sipped my cocktail at an outdoor table, absorbing the euphoria of a perfect spring evening, the words felt more like an apt description than a promotion.\n\nIn a haze of cigarette smoke and laughter, a full spectrum of my Parisian neighbors filled the crowded tables: a vivacious fashionista in huge red eyeglasses chatting with a Franco-African woman in a motorcycle jacket; a male couple in Ray-Bans cuddling at the next table. Behind me, two older women clinked wineglasses and leaned forward to hear each other amid the funk-music groove.\n\nTwilight was falling. A Parisian night was about to flare into fullness.\n\nThe last time I visited La Belle \u00c9quipe cafe, a five-minute walk from my apartment, the outdoor space was an ocean of flowers, candles and hand-scrawled condolence notes. Hundreds of mourners gathered, whispering prayers for the 19 people gunned down there just two nights earlier, during the terror attacks of Nov. 13. Some longtime friends from the nearby Caf\u00e9 des Anges, my corner cafe, had been among the casualties.\n\nOnce again, my neighborhood, the 11th Arrondissement of Paris, felt like the most shattered place in Europe. The first time was in January 2015, when French-born Islamic extremists stormed the offices of the satirical newsweekly Charlie Hebdo, an attack that resulted in 12 deaths. On Nov. 13, the Islamic State unleashed teams with Kalashnikovs and explosives to multiple hangouts in this area, as well as in the adjacent 10th Arrondissement and the Stade de France sports arena. That freewheeling Friday evening became an apocalyptic night of fear and blood. Some 130 people were killed.\n\nHorror and mourning. Destruction and rebuilding. Shattered lives and a return to the quotidian. Paris, and other parts of Europe rocked by terrorism, tilt dizzily back and forth these days. Thanks to support from friends and family \u2014 and Parisian solidarity, in general \u2014 I have managed to keep my balance and move ahead with life in this city that I have chosen as my home.\n\nFor years people have asked me, why did you move to France? French people ask with pride. Americans ask with a dreamy look in their eyes.\n\nI know that look well. I was raised by Francophiles. My father lit out for Paris in the 1950s and spent months in a cheap hotel in the St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s neighborhood. He drank beers at Brasserie Lipp and picked up his mail from the old American Express office near the opera house. My mother arrived in the mid-1960s for her junior college year abroad. She returned with paperbacks by Sartre, Beckett and Simone de Beauvoir and albums by Charles Aznavour and Georges Brassens.\n\nI grew up with my mother\u2019s soundtrack and my father\u2019s stories. Going to France someday seemed as natural as going to college or getting a job. The Paris they evoked, reaffirmed by films like \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d \u201cLast Tango in Paris\u201d and \u201cDiva,\u201d was a moody, twilight city of long nights and endless intrigue.\n\nI set out in 2004 with an aspiring writer\u2019s predictable visions: the cozy bookshops of St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s; the avant-garde architecture and contemporary art of the Centre Pompidou; the twisting hillside streets of Montmartre; the raspberry sorbet at Berthillon; the hot chocolate of the Caf\u00e9 de Flore; revival cinema houses in the Latin Quarter; nocturnal picnics overlooking the Seine; the red neon sleaze of Pigalle; wine bars; jazz clubs; sunrise over the mansard rooftops.\n\nParis delivered those rewards and more, though French life has proved far more complicated and \u2014 lately \u2014 volatile. Only with time would I learn some of the less savory aspects of Paris society and French politics, notably the fallout from French colonialism in North and West Africa, the Algerian war of the 1960s, and an inchoate attempt to integrate immigrants from those countries into French life.\n\nBut nothing could prepare anyone for Nov. 13. The aftermath for some of my neighbors was crushing. An easygoing acquaintance named Khaled, a French-Tunisian cool cat who had bartended at the Caf\u00e9 des Anges, was with two of his sisters during the attack on La Belle \u00c9quipe. They were killed; he survived. I saw him a few days later, dazed and red-eyed. Then he vanished from the neighborhood.\n\nA longstanding French friend witnessed some of the shootings while out walking. He hid in a theater and sneaked home in the wee hours. Afterward, he feared being outside. I urged him out once \u2014 once \u2014 for a drink. After an hour, he asked me to see him into a taxi. Then he vanished, too.\n\nEven those of us who avoided the bullets and bombs were scarred. (I was hiding in a bar about a mile from the area when the slaughter was unfolding.) Some expatriates talked of leaving Paris. People I know avoided the M\u00e9tro for a time. Others steered clear of monuments. My friends\u2019 12-year-old son was instructed on survival techniques in case of a terrorist attack on his school.\n\nI went back to New York City, my hometown, in late December, as I do every year, to visit friends and family. This time, I found myself wondering: Why return to the tragedy of Paris and the turmoil of Europe?\n\nBut I felt a connection \u2014 both geographically and morally \u2014 to the challenges in Europe and beyond. I was finally feeling at home amid the city\u2019s grand boulevards and splintering medieval passages. And I didn\u2019t want to be Paris\u2019s fair-weather fan. So I returned \u2014 eager, but unsure of what might unfold next.\n\nBeyond my neighborhood, beyond France, the view sometimes appears equally cloudy. Sometimes I unroll an imaginary map and trace a trail of favorite cities in Europe that have also suffered terrorist nightmares in recent years. Brussels, our neighbor to the north, in March. Copenhagen, a frequent stop during three decades of visiting my Danish stepmother and stepbrothers, where a gunman opened fire on a cafe and a synagogue in February of 2015. Istanbul, a storybook city that I visit almost every year.\n\nSometimes my travels turn up ghosts. In Parma, Italy, this spring, I spent days dreaming only of my next meal. Hocks of air-cured Parma ham and blocks of Parmigiano cheese awaited around every corner. Then, passing the city\u2019s venerable university, the face of Guillaume, an old friend, materialized in my mind. A former bartender at my corner hangout, Caf\u00e9 des Anges, he was part of the group gunned down on Nov. 13 at the nearby Belle \u00c9quipe cafe. He had studied and lived in Parma, a fact that I had forgotten until that moment. Funny, sly and fluent in Italian, he had been training recently to become a schoolteacher. I leaned against a wall, face to face with his terrible end once again.\n\nIn spite of these attacks, I don\u2019t travel around Europe any differently than I did before. I don\u2019t pack survival gear; I don\u2019t buy travel insurance. I\u2019m not constantly looking over my shoulder \u2014 or at State Department travel warnings, which almost urge you to compose a will before crossing a border. Why?

Her fuzzed-out folk songs typically present her as both Gothic songstress and ragged rocker.\n\nOn \u201cApokalypsis,\u201d her sophomore album, Wolfe appeared in a portrait with her eyes wide open, but you couldn\u2019t see her pupils. They had been painted over, rendering them deep pockets of white. The image completely suited the music, which Wolfe prefers to keep open to interpretation.\n\n\u201cThat album is a lot about revelations and epiphanies and realizing the truth about your own life or the world around you,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe cover was supposed to visually represent the moment of enlightenment and feeling like your mind is open. That\u2019s why the eyes are whited out like that.\u201d\n\nLast year Wolfe followed that record with \u201cUnknown Rooms: A Collection of Acoustic Songs,\u201d which swept away the cobwebs and feedback of her earlier work to reveal Wolfe as a tender songwriter.\n\nFrom the road en route to a show in Vancouver recently, Wolfe checked in with the Globe ahead of her performance at the Sinclair on Wednesday with a full band.\n\nQ. You give the impression that you\u2019re creatively restless, maybe not very good at sticking to one genre.\n\nA. Definitely not. That\u2019s always been my blessing and my curse. Some people think of it as a curse because they don\u2019t know where to put me. I can\u2019t be put in a specific genre, but that\u2019s OK.\n\nQ. Your image, though, has been somewhat consistent. How important is an aesthetic?\n\nA. It\u2019s important for any artist to have a visual presence. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a purposeful thing. I\u2019ve just been trying out any idea I have, and it ties the music together in a cohesive way, even though the songs are all different. There\u2019s a darkness there that\u2019s part of my personality and my art.\n\nQ. Do you think people get the wrong idea about you based on your music or image?\n\nA. I\u2019ve had people ask if I\u2019m into certain cults that I have nothing to do with. But it doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m always really honest. If I\u2019ve heard of it, I\u2019ll talk about it. I like people. I like talking to people. Even though my visual aesthetic is somewhat defined, I feel like my music is open for interpretation. I don\u2019t like to explain what songs are about too often. I want people to inject their own stories and experience into them. That\u2019s how I like to look at music.\n\nQ. You grew up with a father who had a country band. What are some of your earliest musical memories?\n\nA. They mostly involve my dad. He had a home studio, and he and his band would practice there and do a lot of Fleetwood Mac covers. I remember really liking Fleetwood Mac but not knowing those were their songs when I was little. So I was listening to Fleetwood Mac via my dad\u2019s country band. I started experimenting in his home studio and writing and recording songs when I was 8 or 9 years old.\n\nQ. What did a 9-year-old Chelsea Wolfe sound like?\n\nA. My dad made me a compilation of all those songs I did when I was a kid. I\u2019ll have to find it. It\u2019s probably in a box under my bed. If I ever find it, I\u2019ll give it you.\n\nQ. What was your first song?\n\nA. The first song I ever did was a cover of \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d [by Lesley Gore]. I also covered \u201cThe Neverending Story\u201d theme song.\n\nQ. You\u2019ve said that even though you grew up around musicians, you never considered becoming one yourself. What was that?\n\nA. I think a lot of it had a lot to do with confidence issues and not feeling like I was meant to be a performer or someone who had a presence in front of people. It took a long time to get over that. Fortunately a lot of my friends kept encouraging me, and I finally started taking it more seriously and realized it was something I could do.", "summary": "On \u201cApokalypsis,\u201d her sophomore album, singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe appears in a portrait with her eyes wide open, but you can\u2019t see her pupils.

Over the next 30 years climate change is likely to open up a polar shipping route between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, cutting travel time to Asia by 40% and allowing Russia's vast oil and gas resources to be exported to China, Japan and south Asia much faster.\n\nNadym stands to benefit from a warmer climate more than any other Arctic city \u2013 the Russian government plans to connect it by road and rail to other oil and gas centres; Gazprom, the world's largest gas company, is building a port nearby with French oil major Total; and if the new northern sea route is open for even six months of the year, Nadym will find itself on the 21st-century equivalent of the ancient silk route.\n\n\"The entire centre of gravity of the world economy is shifting to Nadym,\" said the mayor, Stanislav Shegurov, a former gas worker, at a recent meeting of Arctic leaders in Norway.\n\nExpectations are high that the route will complement the Suez canal as a key waterway for trade to and from Asia. \"The Arctic is our home and our future. We will make full use of the northern sea route. We are building infrastructure, we are making history. We have ambitious plans,\" said Anton Vasiliev, Russian ambassador for the Arctic.\n\nOnly 71 large ships, working mostly with Russian icebreakers, navigated the route in 2013, but Russia expects a 30-fold increase in shipping by 2020 and ice-free water over most of its length by 2050. The summer ice has declined by nearly 50% in 40 years and by 2050, say Laurence Smith and Scott Stephenson of the University of California, ordinary vessels should be able to travel easily along the northern sea route and ice-strengthened ships should be able to pass over the pole itself.\n\nConfidence that the Arctic will become economically important is seen in the rush of countries and companies to claim a stake. Eleven countries, including Poland and Singapore, have appointed Arctic ambassadors to promote their national interests.\n\nGazprom last week launched in South Korea the first of four giant \"ice-class\" natural gas carriers for the sea route. The Russian government plans to spend more than $3bn reopening a military base on the Novosibirsk Islands and is building new icebreakers and navigational centres. Oil giant Rosneft and ExxonMobile will start drilling for oil in the Kara Sea this year.\n\nNorway and the other Nordic countries have all made Arctic development a priority. \"The Arctic is changing rapidly. It will be our most important foreign policy area. Climate change is putting Norway under pressure,\" said its prime minister, Erna Solberg.\n\nFinland, which has no access to the northern sea route, has proposed a railway linking its mines to the Russian coast. \"Finland needs a new Nokia. The Arctic could be it,\" said its Arctic affairs ambassador, Hannu Halinen.\n\nAmerican, Canadian, Japanese, South Korean and British companies all intend to use the sea route to mine across the region, but no country hopes to gain more than China, according to Wang Chuanxing, polar researcher at Tongji University, Shanghai. \"China's economy is 50% dependent on trade. The development of the northern sea route would have a major impact on its economy. One-third of China's trade is with the EU and the US. The opening of the northern sea route is vital for China,\" he said. Japan also hopes to benefit. \"Ten per cent of the world's unexploited crude oil and 20% of its natural gas is said to be in the Arctic. Recent changes because of climate change are attracting people in Japan. We want to actively participate. We are researching the Arctic sea route,\" said Toshio Kunikata, the Japanese ambassador in charge of Arctic affairs.\n\n\"A great chess game is being played with countries staking claims to the Arctic to make sure they are not left out. Climate change is taking place at twice the global average speed in the Arctic. Some countries, like China, are looking 50 years ahead,\" said Malte Humpert, director of the Washington-based thinktank the Arctic Institute.\n\n\"The polar research institute of China said that Arctic shipping would play a major role in the country's future trade, and suggested that, by the year 2020, 5%-15% of China's trade value \u2013 about $500bn \u2013 could pass through the Arctic. But that may be too hasty. We think the route will mostly benefit China's trade with Europe, but this is not likely to be because its priority is to build closer ties with Latin America and Africa.\n\n\"We think future shipping in the polar region will mostly consist of seasonal activity and transporting the region's natural resources to markets in east Asia. Climate change will transform the frozen north into a seasonally navigable ocean, but Arctic shipping routes will not become a new silk road for China.\" says Humpert.\n\nNorwegian shippers are cautious, too. \"Sailing trans-arctic from Yokohama to Hamburg would shave 40% off the distance compared to the Suez Canal. Yet our own predictions have been modest. In 2013 there were 71 commercial transits through the polar sea, compared with 18,000 and 14,000 through the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal,\" said Sturla Henriksen, head of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association.\n\n\"In 30 years, more than two-thirds of the volume of Arctic summer ice has disappeared.\n\n\"Our children will be the first generation in modern history to experience an entirely new ocean opening up. The Arctic has now become a true strategic hot spot at the centre of global interest. The high north embodies high stakes.

The other, the Telem Party formed by Moshe Dayan, has two seats and intends to decide its position Wednesday morning.\n\nSays Public Attention Was Goal\n\nThe economic issue was the immediate cause of the no-confidence motion that will be introduced by the Labor alignment Wednesday. The party chief, Mr. Peres, said the purpose was not to bring down the Government but to put the matter before the public.\n\n''We didn't expect the Government to fall,'' he said. ''The issue will be brought to the attention of the public and the purpose will have been achieved.''\n\nGovernment officials were in negotiations with the Telem Party, reportedly offering its two members ministerial posts in an effort to bring the party into the coalition.\n\nPrime Minister Begin has said in recent months that he would like to hold early elections, preferably in November, and he was understood today to be hoping that his coalition could set a date without losing a vote of confidence.\n\nTwo key members of the coalition, the National Religious Party and the orthodox Agudath Israel Party, are reportedly opposed to early elections; they are not confident of gaining seats - the religious party has six, Agudath Israel four - and their current tactical position of being essential to the survival of the Government could not be improved. Labor Party Seeking Support\n\nMr. Peres and his Labor Party, meanwhile, were continuing negotiations in an effort to court potential Government supporters away from Mr. Begin's camp.\n\nThe Telem Party was reportedly offered a Cabinet seat in any future Government by both Labor and the Likud bloc. But Telem was said to have put a condition on joining a government, namely that Mr. Dayan's proposal that Israel proceed by itself with an autonomy, or self-administration, plan for Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip should be put into effect without waiting for success in the long-stalled negotiations with Egypt.\n\nThe Tehiya Party apparently expressed willingness to join Mr. Begin's Government only if the Prime Minister made some move to secure permanent Israeli control over the West Bank, including the annexation of the area. Mr. Begin was described by an aide as having resisted this as a violation of the Camp David accords.\n\nThe defecting Likud members, Mr. Linn and Mr. Peretz, gave different reasons at a news conference today for their decisions. Mr. Linn said that the Likud bloc had declined to support his candidacy for Mayor of Haifa and that he was disturbed by Government moves that have alienated the Israeli Arab population. Mr. Peretz, a Jewish immigrant from Morocco, said that he was unhappy with the Likud's performance in the social and economic fields and that Labor had promised action on those fronts.\n\nWith their switch, Mr. Begin's Likud bloc is reduced to 46 seats, as against Labor's 50. Mr. Begin also counts the National Religious Party's six seats, the Agudath Israel Party's four and the Tami factions's three in his coalition, making 59 in all.\n\nLabor, joined by four Communists and two Shinui Party members, can count on 56 votes against the Government.

But six weeks ahead of its theatrical release, concern is brewing that the flick may not be popular with Christians at the box office.\n\nFaith Driven Consumer \u2013 a movement connecting Christian consumers with companies compatible with a biblical worldview \u2013 issued the results of an online survey, first published in Variety, that indicated a whopping 98 percent of faith-driven consumers are \u201cunsatisfied with (the) Bible-themed movie which strays from Biblical message.\u201d The report suggested that \u201cNoah\u201d could thus face \u201ccommercial challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gave participants a strong contextual understanding, and many found that the point-of-view the film seems to take is significantly different than what is in the Bible,\u201d Faith Driven Consumer founder Chris Stone told FOX411, adding that his intention was not to tell Hollywood what type of film they should or shouldn\u2019t make. \u201c98 percent indicated this did not meet their needs. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re mad at the film, it just doesn\u2019t appeal to them.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stone, the information about \u201cNoah\u201d presented to those participating in the survey included press reports about a focus group\u2019s reaction to an early cut of the movie, as well as \u201cNoah\u201d trailers and marketing materials.\n\nStone said the survey got more than 5,000 responses.\n\nIt also got a big response from Paramount.\n\nThe studio issued a release staying the survey question did not contain any reference to the film \u201cNoah\u201d and argued that other statistics cast a much rosier picture for the film. According to Paramount, Nielsen\u2019s National Research Group has defined the film as \u201cvery religious,\u201d and found that 83 percent of those aware of \u201cNoah\u201d want to see it.\n\nVariety magazine, however, rejected Paramount\u2019s claim that the Faith Driven Consumer survey wasn\u2019t based on \u201cNoah,\u201d and quoted Stone saying as much.\n\nThe controversy has led many to question exactly who the film is trying to reach, and if it will bomb without support from Christian moviegoers.\n\nBob Waliszewski, director of Focus on the Family\u2019s Plugged In ministry, said if the film strays too far from scripture, there could be trouble brewing for Paramount.\n\n\u201cSome Christians will go if only out of curiosity. But whether the Christian community by and large goes has to do with how respectful and how accurate Aronofsky\u2019s film is,\u201d he explained. \u201cFirst rule of thumb in filmmaking is to at least be respectful, and if this retelling is done in a way that is anti-biblical, Christians won\u2019t relate, and Paramount could have a big money loser on its hands.\u201d\n\nSince early drafts of the script were leaked a couple of years ago, \u201cNoah\u201d has been plagued by suggestions that it portrayed the famous flood as a punishment for man\u2019s disrespect for the nature, as opposed to sins against God. Last year, sources attached to the production told FOX411 that tensions had risen in the editing room, with Paramount wanting to make a more biblically-accurate film, while filmmaker Aronofsky had different ideas.\n\nOthers argue that box office returns for the film, which is slated to open March 28, will depend more on the quality of the content rather than the Christian turnout.\n\n\u201cIt is commonplace for Hollywood to change stories for dramatic effect or impact,\u201d said Ken Wisnefski, Founder/CEO of internet marketing company WebiMax. \u201cI do know people were less than excited by the trailer that debuted at the Super Bowl and in turn, the fact that the movie may not be all that good would hurt its box office take\u2026 not the fact that Christians in mass are avoiding it.\u201d\n\nAnd Brian Godawa, Hollywood screenwriter and author of the Amazon bestselling Biblical fantasy novel \u201cNoah Primeval\u201d said he wouldn\u2019t count the Christian community out just yet.\n\n\u201cChristians are more open minded than many secularists who refuse to go to movies that they believe are Christian in their message. They can discern the good from the bad and appreciate entertainment,\u201d he added. \u201cThe problem comes if the movie is offensive to their \u2018sacred story,\u2019 that is, if they feel that the meaning has been turned into an agenda for another worldview or belief system than the Bible.\u201d", "summary": "Paramount Studios has poured an estimated $125 million into the production of \u201cNoah,\u201d casting big names like Emma Watson and Russell Crowe, and trusting their baby to Oscar-nominated director Darren Aronofsky.", "density": 39.0, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 22.2820512821, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/technology/personaltech/15basics.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2009101419id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/technology/personaltech/15basics.html", "title": "Stops and Starts of GPS Apps", "date": "2009101419", "text": "The ability to use one device to do virtually everything in your life is appealing, and smartphone navigation apps are generally less expensive than a standalone GPS device. But before you buy one, know that these apps come with their own set of compromises.\n\nTHESE APPS ARE HUGE Apps for the iPhone are generally small; both The New York Times and National Public Radio apps take up 1.3 megabytes of space. But most navigation apps are monsters: since most of them store maps on the phone itself, they are usually at least 1.2 gigabytes in size, which means a lot less room for your music and photos.\n\nThat also means that these apps can\u2019t be directly downloaded to the phone, but must first be transmitted to a PC. With a standard broadband connection, that can take hours, plus more hours to transfer the app to the phone. Download a new map or program update every few months, and the process starts all over again.\n\nNOT JUST A SMALLER VERSION Navigation apps still seem to be a work in progress. (For example, TomTom\u2019s list of states is labeled \u201ccountries.\u201d) Early versions were apparently rushed to market and then quickly improved by adding basic feature updates every few weeks.\n\nOf the four GPS apps I tested \u2014 from major navigation companies \u2014 each crashed several times, jolting my iPhone back to the home screen. Occasionally, the iPhone did not seem to recognize that I was even using the GPS feature, and the phone simply shut off. None of the apps could keep up with my driving. I often made a turn or reached an intersection before the map redrew to indicate that I had. At other times, the app showed me making a turn before I actually had.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using someone else\u2019s hardware,\u201d said Tom Murray, TomTom\u2019s vice president for market development. \u201cSome GPS features will only be available in dedicated units.\u201d To increase the responsiveness of the TomTom app, later this month the company will sell a $120 iPhone car mount that it says will improve GPS reception.\n\nGPS APPS CRAVE POWER Don\u2019t even think about running a GPS app without hooking up the iPhone to a car\u2019s charging outlet. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll most likely find that the iPhone, which gets very hot when running a GPS program, dies before you reach your destination.\n\nOUT OF COUNTRY, OUT OF APP Unlike many stand-alone GPS devices, the iPhone apps for the United States and Canada cover just that. Many of the companies offer maps for other countries, but if you want them you have to download a different version of the entire app, for the full price.\n\nYOU BUY IT, YOU OWN IT Are you ready to drop $70 to $100 on an app you\u2019ve never tried? You can always return a dedicated GPS device to the store, but at Apple\u2019s App Store, all sales are final. At least six GPS apps are available for the iPhone. I took a look at the four most popular. Here\u2019s what I found.\n\nAT&T NAVIGATOR AT&T\u2019s app stores its map data on a remote server rather than on the iPhone. As a result, the Navigator\u2019s program size is small and downloads quickly. Maps are always up-to-date, continually amended with real-time traffic information that automatically reroutes you in case of a tie-up. But if you lose your cellular signal, you also lose your GPS service.\n\nUnlike most other GPS apps, AT&T doesn\u2019t charge a set price for Navigator, but a monthly fee of $10. Using it for several years will cost more than the price of a dedicated device, but it may be ideal for the casual user who needs a GPS unit only on vacation or for the occasional business trip. You can cancel and restart the monthly service at any time, or pay $2.99 a day for a few uses a year or as a cheap way to try out the app.\n\nALK\u2019S COPILOT LIVE This app, at $35, is a steal. Its colorful interface, large, easy to comprehend virtual buttons, and clear voice make this app a smart GPS choice. But before you buy, read the reviews. Some users say that CoPilot either doesn\u2019t know the region where they live or makes routing errors. CoPilot couldn\u2019t find a major street in my own neighborhood, because it knew only its official route number rather than its common name.\n\nCoPilot has offered two updates in the last few weeks. The most recent adds spoken street names and uses the standard Apple \u201cqwerty\u201d keyboard. But only one of its multitude of English-language voices can speak those street names.\n\nNAVIGON\u2019S MOBILENAVIGATOR Navigon, a German company, gave up on the stand-alone GPS market in the United States and has devoted itself to creating smartphone apps. Its $90 app will be familiar to iPhone users, as it adopts the common interface of many apps with options strung along the bottom of the screen and standard iPhone clickable buttons.\n\nBut for those who fail to read instructions, figuring out how to enter a new destination can be a challenge. Clicking \u201ccancel\u201d on a route map brings up a dialogue box that asks, \u201cWould you really like to quit navigation?\u201d rather than a less ambiguous response like, \u201cWould you like to create a new route?\u201d\n\nYet once that is figured out, and with a few minutes\u2019 additional work, the app will become familiar. As with iPhone photos, pinching and pulling on the screen enlarges the image.

To him, it was never much of a choice.\n\nHe finished the lap and limped to the side to watch the Americans finish the race and qualify easily for the final. A few hours later, doctors confirmed what he suspected: He had run the last 200 meters with a broken left fibula.\n\n\u201cI heard it and I felt it,\u201d Mitchell told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I figured it\u2019s what almost any person would\u2019ve done in that situation.\u201d\n\nMitchell finished his heat in a more-than-respectable 46.1 seconds, and the United States tied the Bahamas in the second heat in 2 minutes, 58.87 seconds \u2014 the fastest time ever run in the first round of the relay at the Olympics.\n\nThe 25-year-old sprinter from Cullowhee, N.C., said he was diagnosed with a complete break of the left fibula \u2014 but it was not a compound fracture and the bone is expected to heal on its own in four to six weeks.\n\nHe knew what the stakes were when he lined up to run the first leg of his first Olympics. The Americans have won gold in the last eight long relays they\u2019ve entered at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cEven though track is an individual sport, you\u2019ve got three guys depending on you, the whole world watching you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let anyone down.\u201d\n\nHe said he slipped on the stairs a few days ago in the athletes village but didn\u2019t think much of it. Training went well and he felt good when he lined up to kick things off for the Americans. He said he was feeling great, as well, when he looked at the clock while approaching the 200-meter mark, somewhere in the high-20 or low-21-second range.\n\n\u201cI was doing my job,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBut probably at 201 meters, I heard it and I felt it.\u201d\n\nHe credited something more than simple adrenaline for pushing him the rest of the way around the track.\n\n(VIDEO: Sights and Sounds of the Olympics)\n\n\u201cFaith, focus, finish. Faith, focus, finish. That\u2019s the only thing I could say to myself,\u201d he said.\n\nMitchell was a promising high school football player at Crest High School in Shelby, N.C., when another broken bone altered his career. He broke his left arm, and his coaches \u2014 seeing the natural talent \u2014 pushed him over to the track.\n\nWestern Carolina coach Danny Williamson saw Mitchell finish second several times to a future Olympian, Travis Padgett, and offered a scholarship.\n\n\u201cHe was a team person here,\u201d said Williamson, who received the first call from Mitchell after he got off the track Thursday. \u201cAs soon as he came to Western Carolina, no matter what the situation, he\u2019d do anything we asked of him.\u201d\n\nOn the world\u2019s biggest stage, Mitchell took the team-first thing to a whole new level.\n\nHe is the 2012 version of Jack Youngblood, the Rams linebacker who played the Super Bowl on a broken leg. Or Tiger Woods, who won the 2008 U.S. Open on a broken leg. Or, maybe most appropriately, Kerri Strug, whose vault on a sprained ankle sealed the first-ever Olympic team gymnastics gold for U.S. women at the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you write this, but I\u2019d like to believe the only way he would have stopped is if the leg had fallen off,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nMitchell will spend the rest of the Olympics, and beyond, in a walking boot and on crutches. He\u2019ll be at the stadium to watch Friday\u2019s final. The medals ceremony is Saturday and Mitchell would get one, too, since he ran in the preliminaries.\n\nForgive him if he doesn\u2019t leap onto the podium, though.\n\n\u201cI pretty much figured it was broken, because every step I took, it got more painful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was out there already. I just wanted to finish and do what I was called in to do.\u201d\n\nMORE: Lolo Jones Finishes Fourth in the Olympics.

The influx of money, however, also owes in part to an unprecedented workaround of political spending limits that lets the party tap into millions of dollars more from Clinton\u2019s wealthiest donors.\n\nAt least $7.3 million of the DNC\u2019s July total originated with payments from hundreds of major donors who had already contributed the maximum $33,400 to the national committee, a review of Federal Election Commission filings shows. The contributions, many of which were made months earlier, were first bundled by the Hillary Victory Fund and then transferred to the state Democratic parties, which effectively stripped the donors\u2019 names and sent the money to the DNC as a lump sum.\n\nOf the transfers that state parties made to the DNC for which donor information was available, an overwhelming proportion came from contributions from maxed-out donors:\n\nOn average, 83 percent of the money that was sent from the state committees to the DNC in July originated with a donor who had already given the maximum $33,400 to the national party.\n\nJuly transfers from state commmittees to DNC\n\nThe Hillary Victory Fund was formed almost a year ago to combine the fundraising power of Clinton\u2019s campaign and 33 state Democratic parties. Campaign finance watchdogs have questioned whether the arrangement is proper, and news reports have shown that the state parties have been paying most of the money they receive back to the national party.\n\nThe committees haven\u2019t been accused of any wrongdoing, and election lawyers say the practice doesn\u2019t appear to violate campaign finance law. It\u2019s unclear whether the donors are aware of the transfers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any case law or regulations that would prohibit a state party from transferring to a national party committee funds raised through a joint fundraising committee,\u201d Robert Kelner, an election law expert at Covington & Burling said. \u201cBut as a practical matter, it does appear that the DNC may be using Hillary Victory Fund as a mechanism for allowing donors to give more to the DNC indirectly than would otherwise be permitted directly.\u201d\n\nJosh Schwerin, a spokesman for the campaign, said in an e-mail that \u201cHillary Clinton has fought for campaign finance reform her entire career and, as President, will make it a priority to overturn Citizens United and restore the role of everyday voters in elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese funds help strengthen our Democratic Party infrastructure in critical areas such as data, analytics, research and communications,\u201d DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach said about the transfers to the DNC, \u201cand these improvements help each and every state party as well as candidates up and down the ballot.\u201d\n\nThe Hillary Victory Fund has raised $141.5 million since its inception by soliciting large amounts of money -- up to $366,400 from the biggest donors -- which it then parcels out in appropriate increments to the Clinton campaign (maximum $2,700), the DNC (maximum $33,400) and a variety of state parties (each with a limit of $10,000).\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how the some top donors\u2019 money finds its way back to DNC\u2019s coffers:\n\nOn March 25, 2016, hedge fund manager S. Donald Sussman gave $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund.\n\nIn April, it transferred $33,400 to the DNC in Sussman's name, maxing him out of giving any more money to that group in this election.\n\nOn April 25, the Hillary Victory Fund included $10,000 of Sussman's money in a $179,000 transfer made to the Democratic Party of South Carolina.\n\nThat same day, South Carolina transferred the full $179,000, to the DNC, except now without reference to the original donors. (The state party isn't required by law to disclose the source of funds.)\n\nSussman\u2019s original contribution to Hillary Victory Fund has been similarly allocated to at least 10 other states, and each time has been passed on to the DNC on the same day. That makes his total effective contribution to the DNC about $133,400. (Sussman is Clinton\u2019s biggest donor this election, having given more than $11 million to support her bid, mainly through super-PACs.)\n\nAnd the handling of Sussman\u2019s donation isn\u2019t unique. Overall in 2016, funds from 410 maxed-out donors have been routed to the DNC through state parties, totaling $9.3 million. The fund has transferred $220,000 of contributions from media mogul Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl to the DNC via state parties, the same amount from billionaires J.B. and Mary Pritzker, and $110,000 from Chicago publishing tycoon Fred Eychaner. All are among the top ten donors supporting Clinton.\n\nThe Pritzkers declined to comment. Sussman, the Sabans and Eychaner didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThere\u2019s no sign that the Republicans are following the same strategy. Donald Trump\u2019s joint fundraising committee has yet to transfer any money to the 11 state Republican parties that are part of the arrangement.\n\nWhile election law limits how much an individual can give to any one party, the state and national committees are allowed to transfer unlimited amounts between one another. That ability, together with a 2014 Supreme Court decision that eliminated an aggregate limit on how much a person could give to all parties, opens the door for sophisticated fundraising operations to in effect get around donation limits.\n\nGenerally, the Hillary Victory Fund has been transferring money to states that don\u2019t have tight races that are unlikely to attract the attention of major donors: Wyoming, Indiana, Massachusetts and West Virginia. By channeling that money back to the national party, the DNC can freely direct how and where to spend the money, including in battleground states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Nevada and Ohio.\n\nThe amount of money from maxed-out donors could be higher. Four state parties that received $2.8 million in transfers from the Hillary Victory Fund in July didn\u2019t disclose the names of the donors who were the source of the funds, as FEC regulations require. In each case, the identical amount of incoming money was sent to the DNC the same day it was received.\n\nParties and politicians have long used transfers to get around limits on political spending. Before the 2002 McCain-Feingold Campaign Reform Act, national parties would shuffle big corporate donations to their states affiliates that weren\u2019t restricted on how they could use soft money. In exchange, the states would send back hard dollars -- contributions from individuals that didn\u2019t exceed FEC limits -- that they could use however they saw fit.\n\nLawrence Noble, general counsel of the money-in-politics watchdog Campaign Legal Center, said that while money has always changed hands between state and national party committees, the practice has taken off this election.\n\n\u201cThe amounts of money are unprecedented,\u201d Noble said of the Hillary Victory Fund\u2019s transfers to states and on to the DNC. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to get around the contribution limits; it\u2019s a major loophole in the law.\u201d", "summary": "An unprecedented workaround of spending limits lets the DNC tap into millions", "density": 2.8333333333, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 114.8333333333, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/sports/baseball/yoenis-cespedes-the-key-for-new-york-mets.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015121019id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/sports/baseball/yoenis-cespedes-the-key-for-new-york-mets.html", "title": "Good News: Mets Lose Out on Ben Zobrist", "date": "2015121019", "text": "Ben Zobrist, the apple of the Mets\u2019 eye this off-season, decided to spurn the family Wilpon and sign with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nChicago\u2019s proximity to Zobrist\u2019s family home in Nashville was said to play a role. That would have made sense when paddle-wheel riverboats were the preferred means of transport, but less so since Orville Wright and the advent of winged flying devices. (Chicago is 1 hour 20 minutes by plane from Nashville; New York City is 2:20.)\n\nMore likely, the fact that Cubs Manager Joe Maddon and Zobrist enjoyed many years together with Tampa Bay was the deciding factor. And Theo Epstein, the Cubs\u2019 president, has displayed a willingness to spend and spend again.\n\nThe Wilpons have displayed no willingness to do any such thing.\n\nStill, this is a good test for the Mets. Zobrist, who will be 35 in May, was the wrong player at the wrong time for the Mets, who offer a peculiar mix of fuzzy-cheeked youth and the creaky-boned aged.\n\nBy the spring, this team will have a 37-year-old left fielder, a 35-year-old right fielder and a sore-backed 33-year-old third baseman. It did not need to pay a new second baseman until the cusp of his fifth decade.\n\nInstead, the Mets, blessed with an abundance of strong pitching arms, need to pursue a genuine power hitter, like that fellow Yoenis Cespedes, who patrolled the outfield and led the team during its stirring pennant run last season. If not Cespedes for the rest of us \u2014 the Mets pretend to have all but lost his telephone number \u2014 then two other top free-agent outfielders loom: Justin Upton, 28, and Jason Heyward, 26.\n\nTo type this is to risk marking yourself as an unserious man as so many fall over themselves to explain that the Mets cannot possibly afford to compete with the likes of Chicago, Boston, the Dodgers, the Angels and, perhaps, even Kansas City.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Mets traded for a second baseman, picking up Neil Walker from the Pittsburgh Pirates for an expendable starting pitcher, Jon Niese. It was a nice trade and perfectly small-bore Mets. It was a cash wash. Later that night, they continued to reshape their infield, adding Asdrubal Cabrera, a former All-Star who ranks among the poorest defensive shortstops in baseball, on a two-year deal believed to be worth a modest $18 million.\n\nStill, however much Sandy Alderson, an astute baseball man, enjoyed Oakland and San Diego, and however much the Wilpons might enjoy visiting Milwaukee, the Mets fit no definition of a midmarket team. Flushing, Queens \u2014 for better and worse \u2014 is not Cleveland.\n\nThe Mets\u2019 claim of sackcloth poverty seems worth interrogating. The Wilpons trusted their grifter friend Bernard L. Madoff, and so fell on hard times. And the debt service on their new stadium is pretty high. But as Howard Megdal of Capital New York has noted, somewhere between $45 million and $60 million rained down upon the Wilpons in this autumn\u2019s baseball festivities.\n\nRatings and ad rates are up significantly on SNY, in which the Mets own a majority share. And as my colleague Richard Sandomir has noted, ticket sales are up.\n\nIf so, we\u2019d like to talk to you. We want to hear from you about what your experience was in watching Game 5, and specifically, the slide by the Royals\u2019 Eric Hosmer that tied the game against the Mets in the ninth inning.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that Alderson and Mets management insisted for years that if only fans came out in greater numbers, the team would spend more. Typically in American capitalism, you produce a better product, and sales rise. Whatever; it worked.\n\nBaseball\u2019s commissioner, Rob Manfred, seems intent on responding as Bud Selig did to his old friends the Wilpons: Manfred is playing the avuncular enabler. \u201cI think clubs should and do spend commensurate with the revenues that are available to them,\u201d Manfred said recently.\n\nThis is silliness. New York City\u2019s veins are clotted with young masters and mistresses of the universe who would love to own the bauble known as a major league franchise. The Wilpons could put the team on the market Monday and count their billion-plus dollars by Friday.\n\nAs for free agency, the Wilpons would do well to start with what they had: Cespedes. The Mets lack many coaches who can speak Spanish, but in a city nearly half black and Latino, you might expect a black Cuban to present the team with intriguing marketing possibilities.\n\nAs to his play, Cespedes is not Willie Mays. He is like a hound after a hare to high fastballs. He swings at a few too many curves off the low outside corner. (These are not disabilities unique to him; Fangraphs has documented that Mike Trout has the same weakness for high, hard stuff.) Nor was Cespedes spectacular in the postseason, although he did hit two home runs and knock in seven runs in nine playoff games before the World Series. Like most of the Mets, he had a bad five-game stretch in the Series.\n\nHis fielding in center field in the postseason bore a resemblance to soccer. That said, he is a natural left fielder, and for his work there with the Detroit Tigers in the first half of 2015, he just won a Gold Glove. His arm is like a javelin in the hands of Achilles: deadly.\n\nAs Fangraphs wrote, if he stayed put in left field, he would rate \u201camong the best full-time players.\u201d\n\nMets management tells reporters \u2014 sotto voce \u2014 that were it to give Cespedes his desired long-term contract, he would be 36 at the end of it. This is a curious plaint, as the team offered a four-year contract to an infielder who would have been 38 when the deal ended.\n\nThe Mets have reached an inflection point. They have a phalanx of terrific young starting pitchers who can toss nasty curves and dial fastballs at close to 100 miles per hour. The actuarial odds are that one of them might tear an elbow tendon, and the economic odds are that one or more might leave for free agency.\n\nAs the Mets learned in the soporific days of June and July, baseball teams cannot live on pitching alone. Someone has to hit. Catcher Travis d\u2019Arnaud might stay healthy all year, although he has not managed that feat yet.\n\nAnd Michael Conforto, in his second season, might blast more home runs. But after 174 regular-season at-bats in the major leagues, Conforto will confront pitchers who have studied his weaknesses. Let\u2019s say he hits .260 with 24 home runs. That is a nice sophomore year, and no shame there. He might not be ready to carry the team.\n\nThe Angels are circling Upton. God only knows how many general managers are whispering sweet things into Heyward\u2019s ears.\n\nOne World Series is no guarantee of another. You wonder if the Wilpons realize they are not running Tampa Bay.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2015, on page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Good News: Mets Lose Out on Their Top Free-Agent Target.

Weeks earlier, in Delanco, N.J., more than 7,000 solar panels on the roof of a massive 300,000-square foot warehouse factored into Delanco Fire Chief Ron Holt\u2019s refusal to send his firefighters onto the roof of a Dietz & Watson facility.\n\n\u201cWe may very well not be able to save buildings that have alternative energy,\u201d New Jersey\u2019s Acting Fire Marshall William Kramer told The Star-Ledger.\n\n- John Smirnow, Solar Energy Industries Association\n\nExperts told FoxNews.com that the biggest danger posed by the panels is that they continue to send voltage down from the roof throughout the building even after power is shut down. In a conventional building, firefighters typically cut off the electricity leading into the house before entering.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, solar panels are designed to generate electricity any time there\u2019s light received by the panels, and that happens in low-light settings as well,\u201d said Ken Willette, a spokesman for the National Fire Protection Association. \u201cSo inherently, those are charged electrical appliances \u2026 there\u2019s a shock hazard.\u201d\n\nSolar panels also frequently utilize the very space firefighters use for rooftop ventilation during structure fires and create potentially dangerous conditions for slips and falls.\n\n\u201cIn some applications, the solar panels have covered 100 percent of the roof, which allows the firefighter no room to operate,\u201d Willette continued. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you want to have happen when you\u2019re operating on a pitched roof.\u201d\n\nWith the panels rising in popularity, firefighters and building industry experts say codes must catch up. The average price of a solar panel has declined 60 percent since 2011 and industry trade groups expect that systems will be installed, on average, every four minutes in the United States by the end of 2013, primarily in California, Arizona, New Jersey and North Carolina.\n\nWhile the price of solar panels has dropped and their efficiency has increased, the U.S. still lags behind countries like Germany, Japan and Spain among solar panel installations. Swedish furniture giant IKEA also recently announced that it will begin selling residential solar panels at its stores in Britain, its first step to bring the renewable energy craze to the global mainstream market. A standard system will cost $9,200, including installation and an in-store consultation.\n\nJohn Smirnow, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, told FoxNews.com that the trade group, which represents more than 1,000 companies, is currently working with Cal Fire and the San Jose Fire Department to improve firefighter response to the systems.\n\n\u201cFirefighter safety is a top priority; we take firefighter safety very seriously,\u201d Smirnow said. \u201cThey need to know what they\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s critically important that firefighters know the products.\u201d\n\nA 2010 report by the Fire Protection Research Foundation found that slipping or tripping on solar panels were potential hazards for firefighters, as well as the possibility of the roof collapse due to the weight of the panels, which are generally made of crystalline silicon or thin-film semiconductor material. The maximum voltage of most systems, meanwhile, is roughly 600 volts, which can cause shock or burns.\n\n\u201cThe industry has to continue to work with the fire service community, both on education and updating building codes to meet firefighters\u2019 needs,\u201d Smirnow continued. \u201cThat\u2019s really where I think we can make the most progress.\u201d\n\nSmirnow said solar panels have only factored into a \"handful\" of fires to date and added that the trade group is now in discussions with national safety groups to conduct training sessions with emergency responders across the country.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand what\u2019s best for the fire service community,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \"What type of education do they need?

The project\u2019s architect seeks in his design to suggest qualities of the sea.\n\nThe Seaport District could get another striking waterfront condo tower.\n\nDeveloper Jon Cronin filed notice with the Boston Redevelopment Authority Monday that he wants to build a 22-story complex at 50 Seaport Blvd., the site of the Whiskey Priest and Atlantic Beer Garden.\n\nThe 250-foot-tall building, designed by architect Howard Elkus, would feature a twisting, angular design out toward the World Trade Center and Boston Harbor. It was inspired, in part, by the city\u2019s recent push for bolder design in the booming Seaport, Cronin said, which has prompted other developers to move beyond the boxy looks that characterized many of the neighborhood\u2019s earlier projects.\n\n\u201cWe had already designed a striking yet cost-efficient tower until I attended Mayor [Martin] Walsh\u2019s speech last December urging developers to build more architecturally significant buildings,\u201d said Cronin in a statement. \u201cWe decided to meet that challenge.\u201d\n\nA residential tower is planned at the current site of Whiskey Priest and Atlantic Beer Garden.\n\nCronin\u2019s architectural team spent an additional year re-doing designs for the building, which is now oriented toward the harbor with a curved design that adds views out over the water and a terraced front along Seaport Boulevard with views toward downtown Boston.\n\nThe building\u2019s location offered a unique opportunity for an iconic structure, Elkus said. The shape of the building evokes billowing sails, he said, and with a bow-like end that calls to mind the ships that ply the harbor.\n\n\u201cThe rotation and movement of this building celebrates the forces of the sea,\u201d Elkus said. \u201cThis building really has a romance with the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d\n\nIt is one of several buildings proposed in the Seaport recently that are attempting to distinguish themselves from the first generation of construction in the booming business district, which has been criticized for being overly boxy.\n\nAt 121 Seaport Blvd., Skanska USA is building an elliptical office tower, marketing to tenants the chance to be in an \u201ciconic\u201d building. Nearby, California-based Cottonwood Management plans to start construction early next year on a $750 million complex of apartment and condominium buildings that are staggered in height and shape.\n\nDevelopers say that demand for space in the district is strong enough to command the higher prices that might come with sacrificing a bit of square footage for more creative designs.\n\nCronin, who bought the site in 2006, is planning 110 condominiums in the building, following a trend toward such housing along the waterfront. Fallon Co.\u2019s 22 Liberty condo project a few blocks to the west sold out quickly \u2014 and at high prices \u2014 this summer, and several more condo projects are in development.\n\nThe 275,000 square-foot building would also include two stories of retail and restaurant space, an underground garage, and a large open-air deck that continues the Harborwalk between Pier 4 and Northern Avenue.\n\nPending approvals, Cronin hopes to start construction in 2017 and open the building in 2019.\n\nA view looking toward Boston Harbor of the planned residential building on Seaport Boulevard.", "summary": "Seaport Boulevard could soon get another striking waterfront condo tower.", "density": 4.9090909091, "coverage": 0.9090909091, "compression": 57.1818181818, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/17/phishing-scam-targets-washington-e-zpass-holders.html", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20150818043146id_/http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/17/phishing-scam-targets-washington-e-zpass-holders.html", "title": "Phishing scam targets Washington E-ZPass holders", "date": "20150818043146", "text": "For the second year in a row, drivers who use toll roads in the Washington, D.C., metro area are the target of email scammers trying to get their credit card information, NBC's Washington affiliate, NBC 4, reported.\n\nThe phony emails target the estimated 2.1 million vehicles in Maryland and Virginia with E-ZPass transponders, used to pay toll road fares electronically, regional drivers' association AAA Mid-Atlantic said Monday.

According to a new CBS/New York Times poll, 60% of Americans say race relations are getting worse, compared to 38% a year ago.\n\nLast week, a black man with a white girlfriend wrote to Slate\u2019s Dear Prudence column about a problem in his relationship: \u201cWe have been talking about marriage for a while, but after the recent shootings, she told me that she couldn\u2019t have a black baby in this world. She is too afraid. We live on the coast in a diverse city and everything else syncs up: our education, political goals, spending habits, etc., but our skin difference has never been more apparent . . . Should we split up?\u201d\n\nNow, I wouldn\u2019t say that people who write to advice columnists are necessarily representative of society as a whole. But this is not the first time I\u2019ve seen this question. Just last month, a black woman in an interracial relationship wrote in to say that she and her (female) partner plan to have a child using a sperm donor.\n\n\u201cShe says, adamantly, we should try our best to use a white sperm donor. My wife isn\u2019t racially prejudiced at all, but she makes the point that it is a known fact that in this world, especially in Texas where we live, it is a lot easier to be white. Especially if we have a son, it is factually safer to not be black . . . Which one of us should relent?\u201d\n\nLast year, Ebony magazine published an article by a white man married to a black woman called, \u201cI Hope My Son Stays White,\u201d explaining how he wants his child\u2019s skin to remain light so he won\u2019t experience racism. And there was a woman who sued a sperm bank for giving her a black man\u2019s sperm by accident because she was convinced her child would experience nothing but prejudice in life.\n\nThis is insane. Educated people in cosmopolitan cities are so concerned about the safety of black people in America that they are going out of their way not to have black children. The Klan could not have devised such a clever anti-miscegenation policy.\n\nAccording to a Pew Report, \u201cIn 2013, a record-high 12% of newlyweds married someone of a different race . . . Looking beyond newlyweds, 6.3% of all marriages were between spouses of different races in 2013, up from less than 1% in 1970.\u201d And the results are clear. According to the Census, between 2000 and 2010, the number of white and black biracial Americans more than doubled. A million more people checked off both white and black boxes.\n\nAs the mother of three mixed-race children I have always taken comfort in the idea that whatever overheated rhetoric is coming out of race baiters on the left like Al Sharpton and those on the right like Donald Trump, ordinary Americans are increasingly happy to settle down with people who may look nothing like them.\n\nEducated people in cosmopolitan cities are so concerned about the safety of black people in America that they are going out of their way not to have black children.\n\nWe may be divided in all sorts of other ways \u2014 most notably, class \u2014 but if we encounter people of other races in our workplaces, our neighborhoods, and our schools, we are happy to let nature take its course.\n\nIndeed, our popular culture has undergone a complete shift. Whereas once multiracial individuals were shunned, now their appearance is practically fetishized. In a Pew Survey, only 4% of respondents say having a mixed racial background has been a disadvantage in their life. About one in five (19%) say it has been an advantage.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that the viral videos of police officers \u2014 some doing their job correctly, others not \u2014 and the Black Lives Matter movement as a whole has sent a terrible message.\n\nThe first part is that white people can never know what it\u2019s like to be a black person. I think this is completely true and yet hardly an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Men also have no idea what it\u2019s like to be a woman. Christians may have a hard time imagining what it\u2019s like to be Jewish or Muslim. What if English isn\u2019t your partner\u2019s first language? Every marriage has to bridge divides.\n\nBut what about having a black child? Our pundits go on at length about the special \u201ctalk\u201d they have to have with their children about how to behave around police.\n\nAs if a white parent could never give this talk or imagine what it would be like for a child to listen to it. The short version is this: Do not break the law. Ever.\n\nIf a police officer approaches you, do whatever they say. They have guns. You do not. We\u2019ll get you a lawyer later.\n\nYes, your child may be stopped by police officers when he has done nothing wrong. In part, you may explain, this is because a disproportionate number of black people are committing crimes in this country. There is not a lot that your child can do about this. Also, his chances of being shot by police officers are, according to a new Harvard study, no higher than a white child. Moreover, they are infinitesimal.\n\nThe idea that it is more dangerous to have black children now than any other time is absurd.\n\nAs the president noted in a commencement address at Howard University earlier this year, \u201cIf you had to choose a time to be, in the words of Lorraine Hansberry, \u2018young, gifted, and black\u2019 in America, you would choose right now.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cWe are not as divided as we seem.\u201d That\u2019s what President Obama told the mourners gathered at the funeral of the five Dallas police officers slain last week.

Yet it was an important component of his victory.\n\nCampaign lore has it that President Obama won thanks to a young, diverse, well-educated and metropolitan \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d \u2014 an emerging Democratic majority anchored in the new economy. Hispanic voters, in particular, were credited with Mr. Obama\u2019s victory.\n\nBut Mr. Obama would have won re-election even if he hadn\u2019t won the Hispanic vote at all. He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004.\n\nLargely overlooked, his key support often came in the places where you would least expect it. He did better than John Kerry and Al Gore among white voters across the Northern United States, despite exit poll results to the contrary. Over all, 34 percent of Mr. Obama\u2019s voters were whites without a college degree \u2014 larger in number than black voters, Hispanic voters or well-educated whites.\n\nIn most Northern states, white voters shifted left. In the South, the opposite happened.\n\nHe excelled in a nearly continuous swath from the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington to the Red River Valley in Minnesota, along the Great Lakes to the coast of Maine. In these places, Mr. Obama often ran as strong or stronger than any Democrat in history.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Trump made huge gains among white working-class voters. It wasn\u2019t just in the places where Democratic strength had been eroding for a long time, like western Pennsylvania. It was often in the places where Democrats had seemed resilient or even strong, like Scranton, Pa., and eastern Iowa.\n\nIt was a decisive break from recent trends. White voters without college degrees, for the first time, deviated from the national trend and swung decidedly toward the Republicans. No bastion of white, working-class Democratic strength was immune to the trend.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the two parties, the Republican candidate did better among low-income whites than among affluent whites, according to exit poll data and a compilation of New York Times/CBS News surveys.\n\nAccording to exit polls, Mr. Trump did better than Mr. Romney by 24 points among white voters without a degree making less than $30,000 a year. He won these voters by a margin of 62 to 30 percent, compared with Mr. Romney\u2019s narrow win of 52 percent to 45 percent.\n\nIn general, exit poll data should be interpreted with caution \u2014 but pre-election polls show a similar swing, and the magnitude of the shifts most likely withstands any failings of the exit polls.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s profound weakness among Northern white working-class voters was not expected as recently as six months ago. She was thought to be fairly strong among the older white working-class voters who were skeptical of Mr. Obama from the start. Most of Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among white voters without a degree was due to his gains among those under age 45.\n\nBut Mr. Trump expanded on Republican gains among older working-class white voters, according to Upshot estimates, while erasing most of Mr. Obama\u2019s gains among younger Northern white voters without a degree.\n\nDonald J. Trump continued the trend of G.O.P. gains among older Northern white working-class voters and reversed President Obama\u2019s gains among the young.\n\nMargin of presidential vote for Democrats of Northern white voters without a college degree, by age\n\nMargin of presidential vote for Democrats of Northern white voters without a college degree, by age\n\nMargin of presidential vote for Democrats of Northern white voters without a college degree, by age\n\nHis gains among younger working-class whites were especially important in the Upper Midwest. Young white working-class voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country. Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among them \u2014 and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weakness \u2014 was evident from the beginning of the 2008 primaries.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s gains among white working-class voters weren\u2019t simply caused by Democrats staying home on Election Day.\n\nThe Clinton team knew what was wrong from the start, according to a Clinton campaign staffer and other Democrats. Its models, based on survey data, indicated that they were underperforming Mr. Obama in less-educated white areas by a wide margin \u2014 perhaps 10 points or more \u2014 as early as the summer.\n\nThe campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012, and found a large number of white working-class voters who had backed Mr. Obama were now supporting Mr. Trump.\n\nThe same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters. Those polls aren\u2019t affected by changes in turnout.\n\nThe best data on the effect of turnout will ultimately come from voter file data, which will include an individual-level account of who voted and who didn\u2019t. Most of this data is only beginning to become available.\n\nBut the limited data that\u2019s already available is consistent with the story evident in the pre-election polling: Turnout wasn\u2019t the major factor driving shifts among white voters.\n\nThe voter-file data in North Carolina, where nearly all of the state\u2019s jurisdictions have reported their vote, shows that the turnout among white Democrats and Republicans increased by almost the exact amount \u2014 about 2.5 percent. The same appears to be true in Florida.\n\nNationally, there is no relationship between the decline in Democratic strength and the change in turnout. Mr. Trump made gains in white working-class areas, whether turnout surged or dropped.\n\nThe exit polls also show all of the signs that Mr. Trump was winning over Obama voters. Perhaps most strikingly, Mr. Trump won 19 percent of white voters without a degree who approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, including 8 percent of those who \u201cstrongly\u201d approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance and 10 percent of white working-class voters who wanted to continue Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nMr. Trump won 20 percent of self-identified liberal white working-class voters, according to the exit polls, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies that were more liberal than Mr. Obama\u2019s.\n\nIt strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white, working-class voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier.\n\nThe notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum. Mr. Trump, if anything, was Mr. Obama\u2019s opposite.\n\nBut the two had the same winning pitch to white working-class voters.\n\nMr. Obama and his campaign team portrayed Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs. The implication was that he would leave middle-class jobs prey to globalization and corporations.\n\nThe proof of Mr. Obama\u2019s commitment to the working class and Mr. Romney\u2019s callousness, according to the Obama campaign, was the auto bailout: Mr. Obama protected the auto industry; Mr. Romney wrote \u201cLet Detroit Go Bankrupt\u201d in The New York Times.\n\nThere was one place where Mr. Romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it: coal country. There he made big gains after the Obama administration pushed climate-change policies that would reduce the production and use of coal.\n\nIn retrospect, the scale of the Democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the Democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of working-class interests.\n\nMr. Trump owned Mr. Obama\u2019s winning message to autoworkers and Mr. Romney\u2019s message to coal country. He didn\u2019t merely run to protect the remnants of the industrial economy; he promised to restore it and \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\nJust as Mr. Obama\u2019s team caricatured Mr. Romney, Mr. Trump caricatured Mrs. Clinton as a tool of Wall Street, bought by special interests. She, too, would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business, he said.\n\nAccording to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the proof of his commitment to the working class wasn\u2019t the auto bailout but the issue of trade: Mr. Trump said free trade was responsible for deindustrialization, and asserted that he would get tough on China, renegotiate Nafta and pull out of the trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 two trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton supported or helped negotiate (she later rejected the trans-Pacific deal).\n\nLike Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump ran against the establishment \u2014 and against a candidate who embodied it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney did. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn\u2019t out to help ordinary Americans.\n\nTaken together, Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigration, trade, China, crime, guns and Islam all had considerable appeal to white working-class Democratic voters, according to Pew Research data. It was a far more appealing message than old Republican messages about abortion, same-sex marriage and the social safety net.\n\nDonald J. Trump\u2019s economic views hold some appeal for blue-collar white Democrats.\n\nPercentage of white Democrats without a college degree who say \u2026\n\nGun rights are more important than control\n\nThe U.S. should get tougher with China on economic issues\n\nFree trade does more harm than good\n\nThat they have a favorable view of N.R.A.\n\nImmigrants are a burden to society\n\nThat they disapprove of Obamacare\n\nAbortion should be illegal in most cases\n\nStricter environmental laws cost too many jobs\n\nSome reductions in Social Security should be considered\n\nPercentage of white Democrats without a college degree who say \u2026\n\nGun rights are more important than control\n\nGett tougher with China on economic issues\n\nFree trade does more harm than good\n\nThey have a favorable view of N.R.A.\n\nImmigrants are a burden to society\n\nAbortion should be illegal in most cases\n\nStricter environmental laws cost too many jobs\n\nSome reductions in Social Security should be considered\n\nPercentage of white Democrats without a college degree who say \u2026\n\nGun rights are more important than control\n\nGetting tougher with China on economic issuesmore important than building relationship\n\nFree trade does more bad than good\n\nThey have a favorable view of N.R.A.\n\nImmigrants are a burden to society\n\nAbortion should be illegal in most cases\n\nStricter environmental laws cost too many jobs\n\nReductions in Social Security should be considered\n\nNone of this is to say that changes in turnout didn\u2019t help Mr. Trump at all. It\u2019s just not the reason he made such large gains among white working-class voters.\n\nThere was no relationship between the change in Democratic support and the change in turnout, or the change in turnout and Democratic strength.\n\nBut the Democrats did have a turnout problem in November. It wasn\u2019t a broad Democratic turnout problem. It was a black turnout problem.\n\nThe turnout probably increased among all major groups of voters \u2014 Hispanics, white Democrats, white Republicans \u2014 except black voters.\n\nThe conclusive data is available in the Southern states where voters indicate their race on their voter registration forms, and they point toward a considerable decline in black turnout.\n\nIn Georgia, the black share of the electorate fell to 27.6 percent from 29.9 percent, and in Louisiana it fell to 28.5 percent from 30.1 percent, according to the completed state turnout data.\n\nBlack share of voters, 2004\u20132012 presidential elections\n\nBlack share of voters, 2004\u20132012 presidential elections\n\nThe data is not yet final in North Carolina, but the black share of the electorate looks unlikely to reach 21 percent of voters \u2014 down from 23 percent in 2012. The data is even less complete in Florida, but there too it appears that black turnout will fall by a similar amount \u2014 perhaps to 12.7 percent of voters from 14 percent.\n\nIn all of these states, the black share of the electorate is still poised to be higher than it was in 2004. It just wasn\u2019t as high as it was with Mr. Obama at the top of the ticket.\n\nYoung black voters appear to be a key driver of the decline. They registered at a lower rate than they did ahead of the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections, causing the black share of registered voters to dip. And those who were registered turned out at a far lower rate than black registrants did four years ago.\n\nThe change in black turnout between 2012 and 2016, by age.\n\nThe change in black turnout between 2012 and 2016, by age.\n\nThe data is not so authoritative elsewhere in the country, but it tells a similar story.\n\nTurnout dropped by 8 percent in the majority black wards of Philadelphia, while rising everywhere else in the city.\n\nThe turnout in Detroit fell by 14 percent. Turnout fell in other industrial centers with a large black population, like Milwaukee and Flint, Mich. It\u2019s hard to know just how much of this is lower black turnout instead of black population decline \u2014 the census can struggle to make population estimates in places with a declining population \u2014 but the turnout certainly dropped faster than the reported population decline.\n\nTaken in totality, it appears that black turnout dropped somewhere between 5 percent and 10 percent \u2014 with few exceptions. It should be noted that the decline in black turnout appears very consistent across the country, regardless of whether states put in new laws that might reduce turnout, like those cutting early voting or requiring a photo ID.\n\nWas the decline in black turnout enough to change the result of the election? It seems so. If black turnout had matched 2012 levels, Mrs. Clinton would have almost certainly scratched out wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Florida and North Carolina would have been extremely close.\n\nBut pinning Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss on low black turnout would probably be a mistake. Mr. Obama would have easily won both his elections with this level of black turnout and support. (He would have won Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin each time even if Detroit, Cleveland and Milwaukee had been severed from their states and cast adrift into the Great Lakes.)\n\nPerhaps more important, the Clinton campaign\u2019s models and public polls all assumed lower black turnout \u2014 and still showed Mrs. Clinton on track for victory.\n\nThe Clinton campaign believed it could compensate for the loss of the Obama coalition by winning the so-called \u201crising American electorate\u201d or \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d of well-educated voters and Hispanic voters \u2014 a caricature of the Obama coalition.\n\nThese demographic shifts have benefited Democrats over the last decade, but most of these gains have come in noncompetitive states.\n\nDemographic shifts helped turn Nevada and Virginia blue in the last decade, but weren\u2019t enough to flip Texas, Georgia or Arizona.\n\nDemocratic gains (percentage point margin) because of demographic changes between 2004 and 2012.\n\nDemocratic gains (percentage point margin) because of demographic changes between 2004 and 2012.\n\nThis year, the exit polls again exaggerated the importance of well-educated and Hispanic voters. Last time, it was said that these voters won the election for Mr. Obama \u2014 and this time that they lost it for Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAccording to the exit polls, Mrs. Clinton fared a tad worse among white voters \u2014 but much worse among Hispanic, Asian-American and black voters than Mr. Obama. And those polls said she didn\u2019t win well-educated white voters, as many pre-election polls indicated.\n\nBut the preliminary Upshot analysis of voting returns, census and pre-election polling data suggests that Mrs. Clinton was stronger among well-educated white and nonwhite voters than the exit polls imply.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that these estimates are preliminary. They will change over the next few years with more data from the Census Bureau and additional polling. But it nonetheless paints an alternative picture that\u2019s more consistent with the actual results, pre-election polls and the consensus of academics and campaign analysts on the electorate.\n\nThe Upshot estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton really might have become the first Democrat to win white voters with a college degree (although it is very possible that Mr. Obama did so in 2008 as well).\n\nUpshot estimates indicate that Hillary Clinton did better among well-educated white and among Hispanic voters than was reflected in the exit polls.\n\nUpshot estimates of presidential vote choice by race and white educational attainment\n\nUpshot estimates of presidential vote choice by race and white educational attainment\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s gains were concentrated among the most affluent and best-educated white voters, much as Mr. Trump\u2019s gains were concentrated among the lowest-income and least-educated white voters.\n\nWhites without high school degrees and those with postgraduate educations moved in drastically different directions.\n\nShe gained 17 points among white postgraduates, according to Upshot estimates, but just four points among whites with a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nThere was a similar pattern by income. Over all, she picked up 24 points among white voters with a degree making more than $250,000, according to the exit polls, while she made only slight gains among those making less than $100,000 per year.", "summary": "New demographic estimates for the election, and a look at how the key alliance of Northern white voters and black voters shrank for Hillary Clinton.", "density": 1.7777777778, "coverage": 0.8888888889000001, "compression": 123.7037037037, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-power-rankings-1.3247891", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015092919id_/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-power-rankings-1.3247891", "title": "CFL Power Rankings: Week 14", "date": "2015092919", "text": "Here's how I rank the Canadian Football League teams through Week 14:\n\nYou can't say there are no winners in that mess of a finish at Winnipeg this week, because the Stamps rode out of town with two points. Not their fault the official made such an egregious mistake. You can say Calgary almost gave this one away, piling up over 400 offensive yards but not earning enough scoreboard points for the effort. Bo Levi Mitchell went 27-of-35 for 333 yards and only made one real mistake, a pick on the opening drive. Most significantly, Jon Cornish carried 16 times for 94 yards as he gets back up to speed after missing most of the season. Stamps weren't super sharp, but these are the dog days of September.\n\nThe Eskies spent the first half goofing around, drawing penalties and keeping the Lions in the game. When B.C. went up 23-7 halfway through the third, the light bulb went off and everyone realized they were embarrassing themselves. Defensively, they allowed just three first downs the rest of the way, and had four two-and-outs and one three-and-outs as the Lions bogged down. Edmonton QB Mike Reilly woke up the attack, creating two TDs and two-point converts, and a pair of field goals from Sean Whyte. No one took a penalty in the last 26-plus minutes. The Eskimos have three games left against lousy teams. Take 'em seriously.\n\nZach Collaros held a presser this week to discuss his season-ending injury. The QB is staying in town and will help any way he can. That was nice. Then the rumour mill spit out the name of Kevin Glenn, relief pitcher extraordinaire, killing time with the hopeless Riders. It would be a good pickup, depending on the price. Right now, Jeff Mathews is the starter, and everyone is saying the right things about how the great defence can carry the load to Grey Cup victory. Cup games are usually shootouts, and you have to have someone who can shoot, so the young gunslinger had better learn how to fire those pieces quickly.\n\nSomebody looked as though they were reading their own press clippings this week. The RBs fell behind 24-10 in the first half thanks to a sluggish offence (126 yards), a porous defence (222 yards), poor special teams and a major brain cramp (12 penalties). Even the sellout crowd fell asleep. Much better in the second 30 minutes but not enough to close the gap in a mistake filled outing. Gave it a run, though. Shame of it was losing the season series, so if Ottawa and Toronto are tied after 18 games, it goes to the Argos. This was the first of three contests in 10 days (yes, it's crazy, but everyone has to do it), a stretch made easier by a surprise home game with the Double Blue.\n\nSome idiot (me) suggested in the third quarter against Ottawa that QB Trevor Harris should sit down in favour of Ricky Ray so the old veteran could settle down the Double Blue. Harris, off his game the last few outings, came out sharper this week, tossing for 168 yards and two TDs in the first half. He slowed in the third quarter but picked it up again by going with shorts and dumps and brought the victory home. Nice to see Chad Owens contributing 135 yards on six punt returns, one for his first run back score in 29 games. Michael and Justin Palardy (who may be related a couple of hundred years ago) handled the kicking game and did well.\n\nOne of the worst officials' calls in years may have cost the desperate Bombers a shot at victory in the closing seconds and could eventually keep them from the playoffs. It's like the famous Joe Btfsplk is hanging around the sidelines. The Blue played their guts out against a team with much more talent, and had a chance to at least force overtime. Not that it was pretty all night, as the offence struggled at times and relied on 161 yards in returns by Troy Stoudermire for much of the good field position. The defence allowed a ton of yards but hung on by its fingernails when called for. And they were right there.\n\nGosh, that was awful. The Larks flew into Saskatchewan to face a normally lousy Riders' defence and did everything needed to make the home side look like the 2013 Grey Cup winners. The Als were unprepared in every facet of the game, an accusation used against Tom Higgins when he was fired four contests ago. Montreal's two QBs, Jonathan Crompton and Rakeem Cato threw four interceptions and the offence only started to move at all in garbage time. Anthony Calvillo is discovering early it's easier to be a quarterback than to coach them. One of the league's best defences allowed 375 total yards and the whole team basically threw their helmets on the field and hoped for the best.\n\nThis is why it's called Rider Pride. Nothing to play for but reputation and the Green and White rolled out to hammer a Montreal club still in the hunt for the playoffs. QB Kevin Glenn started poorly (6-for-19, 125 yards) and improved to not bad. He also had excellent help all around, including 111 tough ground yards by Jerome Messam. The defence has had a rough year but this week looked a little like the killers of old, led by Victor Harris Jr. \u2014 Macho Harris had three interceptions and ran one of them back for a score. More than 30,000 fans had a fun time, went home happy and beamed optimistic thoughts at each other as they drove back up Highway 11.\n\nRookie Jon Jennings tossed a neat TD pass to Marco Ianuzzi at 10 minutes of the third quarter in Edmonton, putting the Leos up 23-7 in a game they had to win. The rest was \"hystery.\" B.C. gave up 22 consecutive points and lost for the third time in a row. Much was made of \"how exciting\" the end was. No, it wasn't. All the visitors had left was an intercepted Hail Mary with time gone. Jennings went 18-of-30, for 281 yards, a pick and two TDs. O.K. RB Andrew Harris had a strong start until he was injured again at the end of the first quarter. Chris Rainey had 104 yards in returns, giving the club some field position. The Lions took 13 penalties for 139 yards and when you average more than 10 yards per flag, that's awful.", "summary": "Malcolm Kelly breaks down the balance of power in the Canadian Football League for Week 14.", "density": 1.4117647059, "coverage": 0.7058823529, "compression": 73.9411764706, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/21/iran-economic-minister-sanctions-not-hurting-us/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2012052219id_/http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/21/iran-economic-minister-sanctions-not-hurting-us/", "title": "Iran economic minister: Sanctions not hurting us", "date": "2012052219", "text": "As Iran prepares to meet again with the U.S. and other countries to negotiate its nuclear program, the country's economic minister insisted in an interview Sunday with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that the crippling sanctions imposed on Iran were not having as much of an impact as believed.\n\nMinister Shamseddin Hosseini argued that his country has a much broader economy than just oil.\n\n\"Last year, the total non-oil exports increased by 30 percent and according to the latest reports that the International Monetary Fund has published, Iran's GDP \u2013 Iran's per capita income has also increased,\" Hosseini said in the interview on CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS.\"\n\nZakaria pressed Hosseini on the argument, asking how it could be that the country is not affected when 80% of its foreign revenues come from foreign sales of oil.\n\nWatch the exchange in the video above (or check out the transcript below):\n\nZAKARIA: You're telling me that these restrictions on oil, particularly if the European Union goes through with them, the Indians say they're buying less from you, the Japanese say they are buying less form you, these are not going to affect you, 80 percent of your external revenues come from oil.\n\nHOSSEINI: We must pay close to attention when we speak of oil revenues and sanctions against oil sales. Who are the winners and the losers of such sanctions?\n\nIndeed, it is difficult, but not just for Iran. And we can all rest assured that there will be a considerable increase in international oil market prices. Now, is this the best approach?\n\nZAKARIA: Just to be clear because this is very important, you think that if the European Union goes through with the oil embargo, which is slated to go into effect in July, oil prices will go up very substantially?\n\nHOSSEINI: Certain, certainly. Even the IMF says that as a result of these sanctions, oil prices will perhaps reach and hover around $160 per barrel. And the decrease in financial and economic output in Europe will truly be felt.\n\nZAKARIA: How long can you endure these kind of sanctions because they are affecting your banks, they're affecting, now, the Senate is passing ones relating to the oil \u2013 the tanker business.\n\nHow long can you continue to withstand these sanctions?\n\nHOSSEINI: We have been the subject, the target of sanctions for the last 33 years. We never went looking for these sanctions, but during the last few years, of course, the volume of these sanctions have increased tremendously.\n\nAnd we believe that those who impose the sanctions have exerted the maximum level of pressure they have been capable of, but the reality that is showing itself today is that the capacities and the economic specialties and strengths of Iran are such that can cause a backlash \u2013 an economic backlash for the imposers of these sanctions and their countries.\n\nThis really shows that the economy \u2013 economic strength of Iran is in such a way that can withstand these sanctions and will not be the only economy to suffer.\n\nZAKARIA: So if \u2013 but if these sanctions do cost you a lot, cost the average Iranian a lot, why not allow the IAEA inspectors in, say to them you can go to every facility including the ones that we have previously not allowed you to.\n\nWe have nothing to hide. You can see all our nuclear programs and certify that it's peaceful and once you get that certification, these sanctions will get lifted.\n\nHOSSEINI: We have said time and time again that we will not give up this unalienable right. We are a member \u2013 full signatory and abiding member of the IAEA.\n\nThere are conversations and dialogues taking place currently, but there cannot be a hegemony and a double-standard in the treatment of member countries such as Iran.\n\nIf these principles can be understood and applied with mutual respect, I think we will be in a much better place.\n\nZAKARIA: Final question, what will the price of oil be in August of this year?\n\nHOSSEINI: I believe that we must, at least, in order to have sustainable growth for the producers maintain prices at $100 per barrel. But keep in mind the following, can the industrial powers get out of the current situation they're in with these prices?\n\nTherefore, the answer being obvious, the prices will go considerably higher than $100 per barrel.

President Bush, in acknowledging the existence of the program in a televised appearance two weeks ago, said that tight controls had been imposed over the surveillance operation and that the program was reviewed every 45 days by top government officials, including at the Justice Department.\n\n\"The review includes approval by our nation's top legal officials, including the attorney general and the counsel to the president,\" Mr. Bush said, adding that he had personally reauthorized the program's use more than 30 times since it began. He gave no indication of any internal dissent over the reauthorization.\n\nQuestions about the surveillance operation are likely to be central to a Congressional hearing planned by Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Specter, like some other Republicans and many Democrats in Congress, has voiced deep concerns about the program and Mr. Bush's legal authority to bypass the courts to order domestic wiretaps without warrants.\n\nWhat is known is that in early 2004, about the time of the hospital visit, the White House suspended parts of the program for several months and moved ahead with more stringent requirements on the security agency on how the program was used, in part to guard against abuses.\n\nThe concerns within the Justice Department appear to have led, at least in part, to the decision to suspend and revamp the program, officials said. The Justice Department then oversaw a secret audit of the surveillance program.\n\nThe audit examined a selection of cases to see how the security agency was running the program. Among other things, it looked at how agency officials went about determining that they had probable cause to believe that people in the United States, including American citizens, had sufficient ties to Al Qaeda to justify eavesdropping on their phone calls and e-mail messages without a court warrant. That review is not known to have found any instances of abuses.\n\nThe warrantless domestic eavesdropping program was first authorized by President Bush in the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, officials said. Initially, it was focused on communications into and out of Afghanistan, including calls between Afghanistan and the United States, people familiar with the operation said. But the program quickly expanded.\n\nSeveral senior government officials have said that when the special operation first began, there were few controls on it. Some agency officials wanted nothing to do with it, apparently fearful of participating in an illegal operation, officials have said.\n\nAt its outset in 2002, the surveillance operation was so highly classified that even Larry Thompson, the deputy attorney general to Mr. Ashcroft, who was active in most of the government's most classified counterterrorism operations, was not given access to the program.\n\nThat led to uncertainties about the chain of command in overseeing law enforcement activities connected to the program, officials said, and it appears to have spurred concerns within the Justice Department over its use. Mr. Thompson's successor, Mr. Comey, was eventually authorized to take part in the program and to review intelligence material that grew out of it, and officials said he played a part in overseeing the reforms that were put in place in 2004.\n\nBut even after the imposition of the new restrictions last year, the agency maintained the authority to choose its eavesdropping targets and did not have to get specific approval from the Justice Department or other Bush officials before it began surveillance on phone calls or e-mail messages. The decision on whether someone is believed to be linked to Al Qaeda and should be monitored is left to a shift supervisor at the agency, the White House has said.\n\nThe White House has vigorously defended the legality and value of the domestic surveillance program, saying it has saved many American lives by allowing the government to respond more quickly and flexibly to threats. The Justice Department, meanwhile, said Friday that it had opened a criminal investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of the existence of the program.", "summary": "Then Deputy Atty Gen James B Comey in March 2004 refused to sign on to continued use of National Security Agency's warrantless domestic surveillance program amid concerns about its legality and oversight; was acting as attorney general while Atty Gen John Ashcroft was hospitalized; Pres Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card and White House counsel Alberto Gonzales made emergency visit to hospital to win needed approval from Ashcroft, but it is unclear whether they received approval or went ahead without it (L)", "density": 0.8202247191, "coverage": 0.595505618, "compression": 8.595505618, "compression_bin": "low", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/2719488249001/gravity-heads-to-theaters/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2013100719id_/http://video.foxnews.com/v/2719488249001/gravity-heads-to-theaters/", "title": "'Gravity' heads to theaters", "date": "2013100719", "text": "This transcript is automatically generated\n\nThe out of this world 3-D scifi thriller gravity and -- -- is led by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock.\n\nVillages are ready earning Oscar buzz for her role as a medical engineer fighting for -- life after an accident leaves her floating in -- Originally made.\n\n-- GM as the handling business and -- Reagan's case if person.\n\n-- -- let me Justin Timberlake leads the as a college kid who loses big get online poker.\n\nThen teams up with a high roller boss played by Ben Affleck.\n\nWho happens to be playing a different game altogether.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton -- after Ron Marcia Gay -- Paul Giamatti and more star in Parkland.\n\nTelling the point of view from Parkland hospital in Dallas the day president John F.\n\nSo I would much most of them you need to -- from the Paul Giamatti also has all is great available on demand and in select -- co starring with -- -- Did you play -- -- turned Christmas tree salesman who find their old ways -- he resurfaced just in time for the holidays.\n\nThink it's and is looking for some -- -- talk to I am not a sexist.\n\nBut -- my therapist -- don't know.\n\nMeanwhile find a long list of comedic stars including Adam Scott and Jean -- in the indie comedy eighth DO DE.\n\nAKA adult children of divorced.\n\nYou're not your father's side of the -- stars got as a guy -- younger brother guessing games forcing him to reunite his bitterly divorced parents.\n\nEvery union which leads to even more drama then their split.\n\nIndie -- 3-D IMAX blockbusters and more all at the movies this week.\n\nEV ER -- -- in Fox News.", "summary": "Out of this world 3D sci-fi thriller led by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock", "density": 4.125, "coverage": 0.75, "compression": 20.8125, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://aol.com/article/2014/08/28/john-lennons-killer-sorry-for-being-an-idiot/20953716/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2014082819id_/http://aol.com/article/2014/08/28/john-lennons-killer-sorry-for-being-an-idiot/20953716/", "title": "AOL.com Article - John Lennon's killer sorry for being 'an idiot'", "date": "2014082819", "text": "NEW YORK, UNITED STATES: ACOMPANA NOTA EEUU-MUSICA-LENNON / PERSONAJE (ARCHIVO) Foto del 09 de diciembre de 1980 de Mark David Chapman, asesino convicto del cantante John Lennon, quien pidio salir en libertad condicional el 30 de setiembre de 2004 tras pasar 20 anos de carcel.

And among its professional clientele are Pierre Yovanovitch, India Mahdavi, Miles Redd and Jacques Grange, who recently used Le Manach to adorn the walls of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Palazzo Margherita hotel in southern Italy, among many other projects.\n\nSo when it emerged that this historic family-run company was in serious financial difficulty, it goes without saying that many were dismayed. Could one of France\u2019s last great fabric houses be facing the guillotine? Fortunately not, for it would be given a reprieve by another of France\u2019s famed fabric houses: Pierre Frey, which acquired Le Manach last spring. Although Pierre Frey is a relative newcomer to the fabric game \u2014 the company was set up in 1935 \u2014 the two share the same ethos: family businesses steadfastly committed to craftsmanship and French cultural heritage, while at the same time pushing innovation forward. \u201cI had always loved these fabrics,\u201d says Patrick Frey, the president and creative director of the company and son of its founder. \u201cThey were the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Aside from the quality of these materials, which is quite exceptional, they are just completely magical. The feel of the cloth, the look of it. . . . What more can I say?\u201d Adding Le Manach to its stable made sense for Pierre Frey, which over the years has also acquired Braqueni\u00e9, Fadini Borghi and Boussac, three legendary mills in their own right.\n\nThe Touraine region, where Le Manach was located, has a long tradition of silk weaving, which began under the reign of Louis XI. The factory produced some of the classic prints and weaves of the 18th century, but it wasn\u2019t until the 1920s that Le Manach really came into its own, when the designers arrived at the idea of creating machine-woven fabrics using cotton. This collection of patterns and petit-point tapestries, known as the Toiles de Tours, was an instant hit and today still features designs influenced by Art Deco, African ornamentation, geometrics and animal prints. Recently the house added a new line, the Nacres de Tours, which is an embellished, more luminous version of the original Toiles.\n\nBut a dedication to master craftsmanship has always made Le Manach stand apart from its competitors. Pierre Frey was so keen to preserve the integrity of the textiles that it has moved two of Le Manach\u2019s original hand looms, which date back to the early 19th century, to its own mill in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. It took four months to rebuild the wooden looms on site. The company even managed to persuade Le Manach\u2019s master weaver, who has worked there for 40 years, to relocate. On each of these hand looms, the house can only produce about a meter of fabric a day. (A velvet sofa, for example, can take up to three weeks to weave.) But that is of little concern to the new owners. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like couture,\u201d Frey says of the tradition. \u201cWhen a client orders from Le Manach they are getting something that is made specifically for them, by hand, not machine, to their palate. It\u2019s a very personal experience.\u201d", "summary": "The French textile company Le Manach, known for its handcrafted silks and velvets, is saved from the guillotine by the famed fabric house Pierre Frey.", "density": 1.7857142857000001, "coverage": 0.9285714286000001, "compression": 26.2857142857, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/08/30/3-convicted-on-charges-in-tennessee-high-school-basketball-rape-case.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2016083119id_/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/08/30/3-convicted-on-charges-in-tennessee-high-school-basketball-rape-case.html", "title": "3 convicted on charges in Tennessee high school basketball rape case", "date": "2016083119", "text": "SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. \u2013 One Tennessee high school basketball player was found guilty of aggravated rape and two others were found guilty of aggravated assault against a freshman teammate, a person familiar with the juvenile court case said Tuesday.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the hearing Tuesday involving the Ooltewah High School students was closed to the public and no ruling was publicly announced immediately afterward. The defendants' names haven't been released because they were in juvenile court.\n\nThe Chattanooga Times Free Press first reported the verdicts.\n\nThe case arose Dec. 22 while the team from the Chattanooga area was playing in a tournament about 150 miles away in the resort town of Gatlinburg. Police in Gatlinburg said three Ooltewah players assaulted a freshman teammate with a pool cue.\n\nGatlinburg police charged three players with the rape of one teammate, though the Hamilton County District Attorney's Office has indicated four freshman players were assaulted during that trip. Ooltewah High School is in Hamilton County, while Gatlinburg is part of Sevier County.\n\n\"Today was an incredibly sad day for all the young men involved here,\" said Eddie Schmidt, a lawyer representing a victim's family in this case. Based on testimony in the case, he said, \"we can only conclude that the coaches involved in this case were either clueless as to what was going on or didn't give a darn about what was going on or implicitly encouraged what was going on.\n\nSchmidt also said the family he represents plans to sue the Hamilton County Board of Education in federal court.\n\n\"These events had been building not just for a couple of weeks, not just for a couple of months, but for years,\" Schmidt said. \"This was almost predictable, what happened.\"\n\nHamilton County school officials didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nAn investigation commissioned by Hamilton County officials showed Ooltewah's basketball team had a \"culture of hazing and bullying\" even before the Dec. 22 incident. But the investigation also said there was \"no evidence\" that Hamilton County school officials or Ooltewah High administrators knew or should have known such an incident would occur.\n\nThe investigation results were released Aug. 19.\n\nThe investigation by attorney Courtney Bullard showed that nine Ooltewah players said the team participated in an activity they called \"racking in\" before the Gatlinburg incident. They said upperclassmen would turn out the lights in the locker room, grab a freshman and punch him from the neck down, without the intent to cause injury.\n\nSevier County Judge Dwight Stokes rejected prosecutors' attempts in March to have one defendant transferred to adult court.\n\nSevier County Juvenile Court Judge Jeffrey Rader ruled Tuesday that the hearing for the three players would be closed \"except to those persons having a direct interest in the case.\"\n\nRader also mentioned in his ruling that Gatlinburg police detective Rodney Burns \"was unable to testify\" because of the aggravated perjury charges he faces in Hamilton County regarding the case.\n\nAccording to an indictment filed against Burns in May, the detective testified there were no \"screams of anguish\" during the incident, even though his written reports noted that witnesses said they could hear the victim yelling. The indictment also says there was a discrepancy in Burns' testimony about whether he tried to call other officials and report the case.\n\nBurns' perjury case involves his testimony at a Feb. 15 preliminary hearing in Hamilton County for Ooltewah High officials Andre Montgomery, Karl Williams and Allard Nayadley, who faced charges of failing to report suspected child sex abuse to the proper authorities.\n\nMontgomery was the Ooltewah head coach, Williams the assistant coach and Nayadley an assistant principal at the time. The charges against Williams have since been dropped.\n\nMontgomery was indicted in May on four counts of failing to report child sexual abuse.\n\nNayadley entered a pre-trial diversion program in May. If he complies with terms of that program, which include performing community service and taking a class on mandatory reporting, the charges can be removed from his record.

Keeping with the theme of humility he has set for his new papacy, Francis carried the statue instead of an aide, and kissed a knee of the figure of the newly born Jesus.\n\nThe occasional wail of babies in the basilica contrasted at times with the sweet voices of the choir.\n\nThe Argentine-born pope has also encouraged his flock to be a joyful church, and he called Jesus' \"the light who brightens the darkness.\"\n\nIn the world's history and our own personal history, Francis said, \"there are both bright and dark moments, lights and shadows. \" He added \"if our heart is closed, if we are dominated by pride, deceit, self-seeking, then darkness falls within us and around us.\"\n\nFrancis has applied this same vision to the heart of the Vatican's own working, saying in past remarks there is no place for person ambition in the clerical hierarchy. Rather, he has insisted, the Catholic church must be one of service to those in need.\n\nEarlier, in the Holy Land, thousands of Christian pilgrims from around the world packed the West Bank town of Bethlehem for Christmas Eve celebrations, bringing warm holiday cheer to the biblical birthplace of Jesus on a cool, clear night.\n\nThe heavy turnout, its highest in years, helped lift spirits in Bethlehem as leaders expressed hope that the coming year would finally bring the Palestinians an independent state of their own.\n\n\"The message of Christmas is a message of peace, love and brotherhood. We have to be brothers with each other,\" said Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal, the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, as he arrived in town.\n\nAt the Vatican during the homily, Francis quoted the Apostle John, saying \"'whoever hates his brother is in the darkness'\" and \"'does not know the way to go, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.'\"\n\nThe basilica ceremony was the pope's only public Mass for Christmas. On Wednesday, Christmas Day, Francis will deliver his Christmas message, meant for the world, from the basilica's central balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.\n\nAs he left the basilica in a procession, Francis was preceded by 10 children carrying flowers, a pair of children each from Italy, the Philippines, Lebanon, his native Argentina and Congo.", "summary": "Pope Francis has begun celebrating his first Christmas Eve Mass as pontiff by placing a baby Jesus statue in a replica of a manger in St. Peter's Basilica.", "density": 3.3666666667, "coverage": 0.8333333333, "compression": 21.5, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/theater/here-lies-progress-asian-actors-fill-the-playbill.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2014062419id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/theater/here-lies-progress-asian-actors-fill-the-playbill.html", "title": "Here Lies Progress: Asian Actors Fill the Playbill", "date": "2014062419", "text": "After decades of inching toward center stage, Asian-American theater actors are facing something that they\u2019ve rarely enjoyed in New York: demand.\n\nAn unusual bonanza of jobs is in the offing from new shows as well as two anticipated Broadway revivals, \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon.\u201d More plays and musicals are also telling stories from Asian viewpoints, a long-held goal of Asian-American artists. And increasingly, Asians are landing roles that traditionally go to non-Asian actors.\n\nThe biggest game-changer is \u201cHere Lies Love,\u201d one of those rare musicals that become critically acclaimed commercial hits Off Broadway and have an open-ended run. Even more uncommon, it\u2019s all about an Asian character. The subject is Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines. With a cast of 17, the show is the first in years to offer the prospect of steady employment to Asian-American actors. Productions of \u201cHere Lies Love\u201d are also in the works for San Francisco and London this fall, with Los Angeles, Seattle, Denver and Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, under consideration.\n\n\u201cAsians are used to being the third actress to the right of the star,\u201d said Ruthie Ann Miles, a Korean-American who spent 10 months in a blond wig on the road in \u201cAnnie\u201d before landing the role of Mrs. Marcos. \u201cThe wig,\u201d she added, \u201cwas supposed to make me fit in with my two white sisters. Those were the things a lot of us did to get work.\u201d\n\nActors say they are also making steady gains in smaller theaters, landing more roles that they describe as \u201cnontraditional.\u201d In recent months a Japanese-born actor played Romeo opposite a white Juliet at the Classic Stage Company and a Filipino-American actor was Bill Sikes in \u201cOliver!\u201d More Asian-Americans have also been creating characters named Heather and Claire who were not written specifically as Asian.\n\n\u201cCasting directors are starting to take Asian diversity seriously, after focusing mostly on black and Hispanic actors,\u201d said Pun Bandhu, an actor who was cast as several minor characters in the 2012 Broadway revival of \u201cWit.\u201d\n\nFor the 2014-15 season, at least three new plays written by Asian-Americans will open Off Broadway \u2014 including one, \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d in which the female playwright, Young Jean Lee, is offering her take on white characters. Such new works are rarer on Broadway; while there have been African-American productions of \u201cCat on a Hot Tin Roof\u201d and \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire,\u201d there has yet to be an Asian-American Big Daddy or Stanley Kowalski.\n\nYet casting does begin next week for \u201cThe King and I,\u201d which will start performances in March at Lincoln Center Theater and feature about 30 Asian characters. \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d which reopened in London last month with Asian-American actors in lead roles, is expected to return to Broadway during the 2015-16 season; the show has more than a dozen Asian characters and originally ran 10 years on Broadway.\n\nBut compared to \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d which have been criticized for recycling some Asian stereotypes, the Filipino-centric story of \u201cHere Lies Love\u201d represents both an artistic breakthrough and an emotional high point.\n\n\u201cFor years I\u2019ve mentored Asian actors to prepare themselves for the lack of Asian parts out there,\u201d said Jose Llana, a Filipino-American actor who plays Ferdinand Marcos in \u201cHere Lies Love.\u201d \u201cUntil now my best strategy was auditioning for Hispanic roles as well, because I can look the part,\u201d he added, noting that he played El Gato in the Broadway musical \u201cWonderland.\u201d\n\nStill, he has slowly started winning roles that traditionally went to white actors. He was cast as Bill Sikes in \u201cOliver!\u201d last fall at Paper Mill Playhouse \u2014 a decision that surprised him so much that he asked executives if the audience would accept him in the role. (\u201cNo one batted an eye,\u201d he recalled.) It was a far cry from his experience in the lead role of Melchior in a Sundance Institute workshop of the musical \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d in 2000. By the time the show reached Off Broadway and then Broadway in 2006, the role had gone to Jonathan Groff, who is white.\n\nTrip Cullman, a director who mostly works Off Broadway, has cast several Asian-American actors, including Sue Jean Kim and Maureen Sebastian, in roles that were not explicitly Asian.\n\n\u201cI like it when the casting of a play reflects my experience of the world around me,\u201d said Mr. Cullman, who is white. \u201cExpanding my collaborators\u2019 notions of who could be \u2018right for a role\u2019 seems to me to be a moral and political duty.\u201d\n\nThe numbers of Asian-Americans in New York theater roles have been stubbornly low for years. Between the 2006-07 and 2012-13 theater seasons, Asian-Americans filled about 3 percent of the roles on Broadway and at major Off Broadway theaters, according to a new study by Asian American Performers Action Coalition, an advocacy group. Hispanics had roughly the same numbers of roles, while black actors had 14 percent and white actors had 79 percent.\n\nOn Broadway, where producers tend to cast Hollywood names to help sell tickets, Asian-Americans actors are still more likely to be the wise adult or the best friend. In \u201cMatilda,\u201d Celia Mei Rubin is in the ensemble and understudies the role of Mrs. Phelps, the kindly librarian who has been played so far by black actresses. In another musical, \u201cMamma Mia!,\u201d Ashley Park is in the chorus and understudies the character of a best friend, usually played by white actress.\n\nSome shows with Asian-related story lines and characters, like recent revivals of \u201cFlower Drum Song\u201d and \u201cPacific Overtures\u201d and David Henry Hwang\u2019s play \u201cChinglish,\u201d have struggled to find audiences on Broadway. A new musical, \u201cAllegiance,\u201d about a Japanese-American family in a World War II internment camp, starring George Takei and the Tony Award winner Lea Salonga (from the original \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d), has waited a year so far to get an offer from one of Broadway\u2019s theater owners.\n\n\u201cYou need Lucy Liu to have a hit on Broadway,\u201d said Tisa Chang, who in 1977 founded the Pan Asian Repertory Theater, which significantly expanded opportunities for Asian-American performers. \u201cBut ideas like an Asian-American production of an American classic are absolutely workable.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s Off Off Broadway, that is. A new \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d is running in a 99-seat theater through June 29 starring South Asian actors as the Loman family, including the show\u2019s producer, Saima Huq, as the matriarch Linda. She put up $25,000 from savings and credit cards to mount the show.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I could ever imagine playing an iconic role like Linda unless I put on the show myself,\u201d she said.\n\nBut \u201cHere Lies Love\u201d did not rely on Asian-American creators or producers; most of them are white.\n\n\u201cIt shows that white and Asian artists can create really great work together,\u201d said Ms. Miles, who was born in Arizona and spent much of her childhood in South Korea. \u201cYou get to tell the ultimate story \u2014 a person\u2019s whole life story \u2014 and that person is a very complicated, very human, stereotype-free Asian who is surrounded by other Asian characters. It\u2019s a dream come true for me.\u201d\n\nBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Monday with an article about more opportunities for Asian-American theater actors in New York misstated, in some editions, the surname of the star of \u201cHere Lies Love,\u201d a show about Imelda Marcos at the Public Theater.

On Monday, when the National Labor Relations Board overturned a March 2014 regional ruling allowing Northwestern football players to unionize, it marked a \"clear victory for the college sports establishment\" and a \"tough break for the Northwestern football team.\"\n\nSorry, but an issue this complicated doesn't fall neatly into a simple win-loss column.\n\nNorthwestern football players only lost something Monday if you're under the mistaken impression the entire team was united in its quest to make history. We'll never know for sure, because the results of the unionization vote the team held will now be destroyed before they're ever counted, but based on reports and the players' public comments at the time, they most likely voted overwhelmingly \"No\" themselves.\n\nIt was primarily one player, former Wildcats quarterback Kain Colter, who, with the backing of leading college sports reform advocates, pushed this issue to the forefront. And if you think he or the nascent College Athletes Players Association lost Monday, you haven't been paying attention to the industry lately.\n\nOver the past 18 months, the NCAA and its members have devoted more time and energy to so-called student-athlete welfare initiatives than at any time in the modern history of college sports. Many of them may have come to pass with or without Colter's push, but let's not kid ourselves. March 26, 2014 -- the day a Chicago NLRB director declared Northwestern's players to be employees -- served as a giant wake-up call to officials across the industry. Especially when everyone from Congress to \"The Colbert Report\" took interest in the story.\n\nAt the time of its advent, CAPA pushed an agenda calling for schools to use their treasure trove of TV revenue to cover enhanced medical coverage and protections for athletes, increased scholarships and funds for former athletes to complete their degrees. Most of all, they sought for athletes to have a greater voice in the rules governing their careers.\n\nIn turn, during the year-plus it took for the NLRB to issue its final ruling, the following happened:\n\n* The Power 5 conferences, through their new NCAA autonomy process, finally pushed through full cost of attendance scholarships, which go into effect at most schools this coming semester, and guaranteed four-year scholarships.\n\n* Numerous schools established \"lifetime guarantee\" funds to pay for athletes who leave school early to return and complete their degrees.\n\n* Most conferences established more stringent concussion protocols, as well as reducing the number of full-contact practices football teams can hold.\n\n* The NCAA for the first time added a student-athlete with voting privileges to its Board of Directors. The new autonomy process includes 15 athletes among the 80 people with voting power.\n\nColter and CAPA may have lost Monday's ruling but not before achieving the vast majority of their stated goals.\n\nOf course, there's still a significant faction of anti-NCAA zealots who won't be appeased until college football and basketball players become full-on professional athletes with million dollar contracts and collective bargaining power. These are the same people who will tell you that 19-year-olds who spend their days training in embarrassingly palatial facilities replete with juice bars and massage suites are \"exploited.\"\n\nBut none of that was ever a realistic outcome of the Northwestern decision, which, had it been upheld, would have applied only to the small number of private schools that play high-level football and basketball. The NLRB on Monday dodged entirely the question of whether the players are employees, instead declaring that the entire issue fell outside of its jurisdiction. The fact it could not have been applied universally to both public and private schools played a major factor.\n\nWithout question, the \"establishment\" dodged a bullet Monday. Had the NLRB affirmed the earlier definition of athletes as employees, it could have set off a ripple of consequences, and certainly would have invoked another round of lawmakers' scrutiny.\n\nBut the upshot of this entire 18-month saga is that the establishment started listening. Northwestern players most likely never would have unionized even if afforded the right, but they didn't need to. They already significantly improved working conditions for their fellow \"employees\" across the country.", "summary": "The ruling that Northwestern players can't form a union might look like a loss, but schools across the country have improved the situation for player-athletes while the case was lingering on.", "density": 1.0, "coverage": 0.7222222222, "compression": 23.4444444444, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/health/policy/15rwanda.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2010061619id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/health/policy/15rwanda.html", "title": "In Desperately Poor Rwanda, Most Have Health Insurance", "date": "2010061619", "text": "It has no running water, and the delivery room is little more than a pair of padded benches with stirrups. But the blue paint on the walls is fairly fresh, and the labor room beds have mosquito nets.\n\nInside, three generations of the Yankulije family are relaxing on one bed: Rachel, 53, her daughter Chantal Mujawimana, 22, and Chantal\u2019s baby boy, too recently arrived in this world to have a name yet.\n\nThe little prince is the first in his line to be delivered in a clinic rather than on the floor of a mud hut. But he is not the first with health insurance. Both his mother and grandmother have it, which is why he was born here.\n\nRwanda has had national health insurance for 11 years now; 92 percent of the nation is covered, and the premiums are $2 a year.\n\nSunny Ntayomba, an editorial writer for The New Times, a newspaper based in the capital, Kigali, is aware of the paradox: his nation, one of the world\u2019s poorest, insures more of its citizens than the world\u2019s richest does.\n\nHe met an American college student passing through last year, and found it \u201cabsurd, ridiculous, that I have health insurance and she didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAnd if she got sick, her parents might go bankrupt. The saddest thing was the way she shrugged her shoulders and just hoped not to fall sick.\u201d\n\nFor $2 a year, of course, Rwanda\u2019s coverage is no fancier than the Mayange maternity ward.\n\nBut it covers the basics. The most common causes of death \u2014 diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, malnutrition, infected cuts \u2014 are treated.\n\nLocal health centers usually have all the medicines on the World Health Organization\u2019s list of essential drugs (nearly all are generic copies of name-brand drugs) and have laboratories that can do routine blood and urine analyses, along with tuberculosis and malaria tests.\n\nMs. Mujawimana gave birth with a nurse present, vastly increasing the chances that she and her baby would survive. Had there been complications, they could have gone by ambulance to a district hospital with a doctor.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, we came here only when the mother had problems,\u201d her mother said. \u201cNow the village health worker orders you not to deliver at home.\u201d\n\nSince the insurance, known as health mutuals, rolled out, average life expectancy has risen to 52 from 48, despite a continuing AIDS epidemic, according to Dr. Agnes Binagwaho, permanent secretary of Rwanda\u2019s Ministry of Health. Deaths in childbirth and from malaria are down sharply, she added.\n\nOf course, many things that are routine in the United States, like M.R.I. scans and dialysis, are generally unavailable. Cancer, strokes and heart attacks are often death sentences. The whole country, with a population of 9.7 million, has one neurosurgeon and three cardiologists. (By contrast, New York City has 8 million people; at a national softball tournament for neurosurgeons in Central Park 10 days ago, local hospitals fielded five teams.)\n\n(In another contrast with the United States, obesity and its medical complications are almost a nonissue. Visitors to Rwanda are quickly struck by how thin everyone on the street is. And it is not necessarily from malnutrition; even the president, Paul Kagame, a teetotaling ascetic, is spectral.)\n\nGeneral surgery is done, but waits can be weeks long. A few lucky patients needing advanced surgery may be treated free by teams of visiting doctors from the United States, Cuba, Australia and elsewhere, but those doctors are not always around. Occasionally, the Health Ministry will pay for a patient to go to Kenya, South Africa or even India for treatment.\n\nStill, even with rationing this strict, how can any nation offer so much for $2 a year?\n\nThe answer is: It can\u2019t. Not without outside help.\n\nPartners in Health, the Boston-based health charity, which runs two rural hospitals and a network of smaller clinics in Rwanda, said its own costs ran $28 per person per year in areas it serves. It estimated that the government\u2019s no-frills care costs $10 to $20.\n\nAccording to a study recently published in Tropical Medicine & International Health, total health expenditures in Rwanda come to about $307 million a year, and about 53 percent of that comes from foreign donors, the largest of which is the United States. One big donor is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which is experimenting with ways to support whole health systems instead of just treating the three diseases in its name. It pays the premiums for 800,000 Rwandans officially rated as \u201cpoorest of the poor.\u201d\n\nIn a nation of poor farmers, who is officially poorest is decided by village councils. They weigh assets like land, goats, bicycles and radios and determine whether a hut has a costly tin roof or just straw.\n\n\u201cPeople know their neighbors here,\u201d said Felicien Rwagasore, a patient coordinator at the Mayange clinic. \u201cThey do not make mistakes.\u201d\n\nMaking every Rwandan pay something is part of President Kagame\u2019s ambitious plan to push his people toward more self-reliance and, with luck, eventually into prosperity. The country has been called \u201cAfrica\u2019s Singapore.\u201d It has clean streets and little crime, and each month everyone does one day of community service, like planting trees. Private enterprise is championed, and Mr. Kagame has been relentless about punishing corrupt officials. In the name of suppressing remarks that might revive the hatreds that spawned the 1994 genocide, his critics say, he suppresses normal political dissent, too.\n\nA more practical obstacle to creating a health insurance system, however, is that most of the world\u2019s poor, including Rwanda\u2019s, resist what they see as the unthinkable idea of paying in advance for something they may never get.\n\n\u201cIf people pay the $2 and then don\u2019t get sick all year, they sometimes want their money back,\u201d said Anja Fischer, an adviser to the Health Ministry from GTZ, the German government\u2019s semi-independent aid agency.\n\nAlso, the co-pays can be overwhelming. Even $5 for a Caesarean section can be too much for people as close to the edge as the Yankulijes, who live by growing beans and sweet potatoes and wear American castoffs (Mrs. Yankulije\u2019s T-shirt read \u201cWolverines Football\u201d).\n\nMany live by barter and cannot scrape together even $2 in coins, said Dr. Damas Dukundane, who works in a poor rural area. Since the government accepts only cash, he said, his patients sometimes go to traditional healers, who could be dangerous quacks but will take goats or chickens.\n\nAs a result of all these factors, Rwanda is a patchwork of small clinics, some richer or better-run than others. Mayange\u2019s, for example, gets donations and guidance from the Access Project founded by Josh N. Ruxin, a Columbia professor of public health who now lives in Kigali.\n\nFor example, the computer that prints the insurance cards has a Webcam on it. Previously, Professor Ruxin said, for insurance costing $2, villagers had to bring in photographs that had cost them $1 or more.\n\nA clearer example of how the system overburdens the poor, he said, was the fact that the wealthiest Rwandans pay the same $2 that the rural poor do.\n\nDr. Binagwaho, the Health Ministry official, agreed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally insane that my mother pays the same as the woman who cleans her house,\u201d she said. \u201cThat law is being changed.\u201d\n\nStill, Dr. Binagwaho said, Rwanda can offer the United States one lesson about health insurance: \u201cSolidarity \u2014 you cannot feel happy as a society if you don\u2019t organize yourself so that people won\u2019t die of poverty.\u201d", "summary": "Ninety-two percent of Rwanda is covered by a national health plan, and the premiums are $2 a year.", "density": 5.1304347826, "coverage": 0.9565217391, "compression": 67.347826087, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/carolyn-hax-limited-discretionary-funds-make-couple-feel-awkward/2015/07/22/05430eec-24de-11e5-aae2-6c4f59b050aa_story.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015072319id_/http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/carolyn-hax-limited-discretionary-funds-make-couple-feel-awkward/2015/07/22/05430eec-24de-11e5-aae2-6c4f59b050aa_story.html", "title": "Carolyn Hax: Limited discretionary funds make couple feel awkward", "date": "2015072319", "text": "Adapted from a recent online discussion.\n\nCarolyn Hax started her advice column in 1997, after five years as a copy editor and news editor in Style and none as a therapist.

In order to make this work, we are SUPER frugal and have had at least one financial-adviser type look at us quizzically and ask how we live on so little money.\n\nThe problem is, we can\u2019t seem to socialize with any of the people around us, because they all seem to have more money to spare. All of our middle-class, college-educated friends seem to think nothing about grabbing a coffee here, and lunch there, taking the kids out to a show, whatever, as long as it\u2019s moderately priced. How can we politely turn things down that we would love to do? How do we explain that \u201cmoderately priced\u201d is out of our price range?\n\nToo Poor for a Social Life\n\nThrough one-on-one conversations. Explain that you want to see them and you want to do fun things, but they have to be free-free. Not five bucks and buy a hot dog at the concession stand, but $0 and maybe pack a picnic. Then follow up by being the ones to suggest things and invite friends to them: \u201cThere\u2019s a free kids\u2019 concert at The Local Arts Venue. We\u2019re bringing PBJs and making an afternoon of it \u2014 wanna come with?\u201d\n\nThen when you have to turn things down, just say you\u2019d love to but you can\u2019t, thanks for the invitation, maybe next time? Even better, suggest a specific thing \u2014 We can\u2019t go, I\u2019m sorry. Next weekend, though, we\u2019re planning to ___. Would you like to come?\u201d\n\nCarolyn: How can I explain this to people I don\u2019t know as well? We often get invitations to go out as a get-to-know-you kind of thing, but it\u2019s very awkward to explain to acquaintances, and I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m asking them to pay.\n\nDon\u2019t explain, just decline the invitation politely, and then make a note to reciprocate \u2014 if not on the spot, then soon \u2014 with an invitation to something you can afford.\n\nRe: Too Poor: There\u2019s no shame in saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not in our budget right now.\u201d If they push you to explain, they\u2019re the ones making it weird, not you.\n\nYes, thank you \u2014 though they\u2019ll still have to be ready with an answer to \u201cOh, come on, it\u2019s just five bucks a person\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s our treat, then.\u201d If they fumble for a response, they could walk away feeling bad despite being technically \u201cright.\u201d\n\nRe: Too Poor: Also give some thought as to how your financial inability to participate in community life affects your kids, and weigh that against the benefits of having a full-time stay-at-home parent. My parents were kind of like you guys. I did like having my mom home, but in middle school, it was really hard to be the kid dressed in out-of-style hand-me-downs who could never afford to go out to a movie with friends. In retrospect, I think the extreme frugality did us more social damage than it was worth. There can be a middle ground, such as a part-time job to allow the family a little financial breathing room.\n\nGreat point.

What is even more disturbing are his comments about the bill\u2019s deliberate lack of transparency. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest\u2019s denials Thursday were also absurd.\n\nThe arrogance and condescension that has too often characterized the Obama administration\u2019s policies have put the American public in the unfortunate position of having to learn about the health care changes the hard way, on their own. Here are three crucial changes that the president clearly didn\u2019t want you to know about: 1. HUGE DEFICITS AND NEW TAXES. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the latest projections for the net cost of ObamaCare over the next ten years are just over $1.4 trillion. Whereas President Obama promised in 2009 that it would cost less than $1 trillion over ten years. In order to partially pay for this, ObamaCare has added more than 20 new taxes totaling over $500 billion.\n\n2. BUREAUCRACY. Speaking of Orwellian politics, ObamaCare includes 159 new boards and agencies to restrict and govern your health care choices. 3. STILL MORE BUREAUCRACY. Dysfunctional state exchanges with high deductible policies, narrow doctor networks, including federally-run exchanges in 36 states which may not be allowable under the law (SCOTUS currently considering this case).\n\nHere are three new things coming up in 2015 that you aren\u2019t going to like: 1. PENALTIES WILL RISE \u2013 INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. In 2014, people are facing a penalty of $95 per person or 1% of income.\n\nIn 2015, the penalty will more than triple to $325 per person or 2% of income, whichever is higher.\n\nIf an American failed to get coverage this year, the penalty will be taken out of their tax refund in early 2015. 2. SERIOUS RATE HIKES FOR CHEAPER OBAMACARE PLANS. According to Investor\u2019s Business Daily, the lowest cost bronze plan will increase an average of 7 % in many cases, the lowest cost silver plan by 9%, and the lowest priced catastrophic policy will climb 18 percent on average. Double digit rate hikes are anticipated in several southern and Midwestern states including Kansas, Iowa, Louisiana, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Iowa, and Virginia.\n\nSubsidies will continue to be a huge part of the program. In 2014, subsidies provided \u00be of the premiums for the federally-run exchanges. 3. EMPLOYER MANDATE WILL TAKE EFFECT. After being delayed for a year, large businesses (100 or more employees in 2015, 50 or more in 2016) will be required to offer affordable (and subsidized) health plans to at least 70 percent of their full time employees or face a $2,000-$3,000 penalty per employee.\n\nThis mandate will lead to fewer full time employees being hired. The latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July revealed that 53 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable view of ObamaCare. I expect this number to rise as more of ObamaCare\u2019s \u201cbells and whistles\u201d are rolled out.

If you have ever accepted a job and later discovered you might be underpaid, the experience tends to stick in your mind and the next time you interview it\u2019s a lesson learned.\n\nTalking about money can be a touchy matter even for the most seasoned professional because of the sensitive nature in wanting the job and wanting the salary you desire. Most money conversations are based on trial and error with a feeling of risk associated in discussing it with an employer.\n\nFor a job candidate who is tired of searching, the temptation to accept an offer can be enticing relief as much as for the employee who wants a raise. However, discussing compensation issues will always play a role in your career.\n\nLong before an offer is extended, the matter of money starts with your first handshake and introduction to the employer. No doubt compensation is calculated from a number of factors such as the marketplace demands, type of organization, position and experience. However, the way in which you address the topic can influence the outcome.\n\nThe best time to discuss the details of your compensation is after you have received an offer. If you start negotiating beforehand, you could be taking a gamble. One job candidate learned the hard way by assuming the employer was talking about an offer and decided to start asking for vacation, bonuses and potential raises. As a result, the employer withdrew the offer. The candidate\u2019s assumption was in poor judgment.\n\nHere are some money discussion tips:\n\nWhen discussing money, keep a realistic view when the salary range is lower than your last job or less than you desire. Don\u2019t get discouraged; be prepared to back up the figure you have in mind with a business reason.\n\nLeveraging emotions as a way to negotiate. \u201cI deserve it based on years of experience\u201d is not a powerful strategy. Instead, negotiate from a power of strength by researching industry standards.\n\nKeep a strong focus on how the company will benefit from your contributions and use your accomplishments to back up your value and worth to them.\n\nEmployers are savvy negotiators; however, you need them as much as they need you. When you receive an offer, both of you share a common goal of employment.\n\nMake it easy for an employer to hire you by doing your homework first in understanding the organizational culture, and listen carefully to the employer\u2019s response. If you sense the conversation is getting tense, back off and look for compromises.\n\nThings to ask for in lieu of money could be: vacation, moving expenses, sign-on bonuses, training or paid professional associations. Compensation includes the entire package and everything needs to be included when making a decision to accept an offer.\n\nDon\u2019t appear needy or desperate; showing your hand early in the process can send a wrong message.

Alexandre Desplat, with music credits on five prize candidates, including \u201cArgo,\u201d pumped hands at the door. Jason Clarke, the star of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d worked the crowd, while Robert Zemeckis of \u201cFlight\u201d and Tom Hooper of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d got lost in the scrum.\n\nWhich raises a question: Are the big guys about to take back the Oscars?\n\nAfter watching indie films like \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d and \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d claim Hollywood\u2019s top honors for the last five years, the major studios are campaigning with a ferocity that could make one of them a winner on Feb. 24, Academy Awards night.\n\nAn unusually early Oscar nominating vote will begin on Dec. 17, with results to be announced on Jan. 10. And as the balloting approaches, every major studio has at least one film with a credible shot at the best picture award, which the last two years went to \u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d both from an independent distributor, the Weinstein Company.\n\nTen days ago Universal Pictures \u2014 which has not had a best picture nominee since it split \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d with Weinstein in 2010 \u2014 introduced its star-laden musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway all sing) with about a dozen Friday and Saturday screenings in Los Angeles and New York. In both cities awards voters were greeted by Mr. Hooper, who won an Oscar in 2011 for directing \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech.\u201d\n\nAs that was happening, Sony Pictures began a series of nearly 100 awards-oriented screenings in London and across the United States of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d another late-season entry that arrives with credentials that make it an instant contender. The film, about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, is directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal, who won Oscars in 2010 as the director and the writer of \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201d\n\nAt the same time 20th Century Fox is in contention with \u201cLife of Pi\u201d from the director Ang Lee, another past Oscar winner (for directing \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d). DreamWorks and Walt Disney have \u201cLincoln,\u201d from Mr. Spielberg. Paramount Pictures is in the hunt with Mr. Zemeckis and \u201cFlight.\u201d\n\nAnd Warner Brothers has kept the heat under its early season entry, \u201cArgo,\u201d even as \u201cThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\u201d arrives from Peter Jackson, whose \u201cLord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d swept 11 Academy Awards in 2004, including best picture. \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d also continues to be a prospect for Warner. (Its director, Christopher Nolan, showed up on Saturday, joining the slugger\u2019s row of studio filmmakers.)\n\nWarner was the last major studio to release a best picture winner; that was \u201cThe Departed,\u201d from Martin Scorsese, which won the top Oscar and three others in 2007. Two years earlier Warner had had a winner with \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d; \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d released in the United States by Universal, took the prize in 2002. That followed a decade in which studio films like \u201cTitanic,\u201d from Fox and Paramount; \u201cForrest Gump\u201d and \u201cBraveheart,\u201d from Paramount; and \u201cUnforgiven,\u201d from Warner, all came up winners.\n\nThis year the studios\u2019 apparently strong position is partly a matter of focus. As the number of sophisticated films from the majors has dwindled, most studios have tended to concentrate their resources on one or two prestige pictures each year. While the studios are zeroing in, some formidable competitors from the independent world are spreading their energy among several pictures, none of which yet show any sign of dominating the race, as did, for instance, \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d from Fox Searchlight. (That indie darling won eight Oscars, including that for best picture, in 2009.)\n\nFox Searchlight, a specialty film division of Fox Film, is now backing \u201cThe Sessions,\u201d with Helen Hunt as a sex therapist treating a polio survivor played by John Hawkes; \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild,\u201d with its fable of life in a watery delta; and \u201cHitchcock,\u201d in which Anthony Hopkins portrays Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nFocus Features, a similar, smaller-film unit at Universal, had a movie from earlier in the year, Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cMoonrise Kingdom,\u201d that picked up five Independent Spirit awards nominations last week, including best feature, even as the company was continuing to campaign for later, prize-season releases like \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d and \u201cHyde Park on Hudson.\u201d\n\nAfter dominating the Oscars in the last two cycles the Weinstein Company and its master Oscar strategist, Harvey Weinstein, appear to be angling for advantage from, of all things, their underdog status. Inside the Weinstein camp last week \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d the studio\u2019s off-center romance starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and directed by David O. Russell, was being called \u201cthe little engine that could.\u201d\n\nThough it was reviewed almost as strongly as studio contenders including \u201cArgo\u201d and \u201cLincoln,\u201d Moviereviewintelligence.com reported, \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d lacks the kind of obvious hook that created media attention, and awards buzz, for \u201cThe Artist,\u201d which was nearly silent, or \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d about a stuttering British king.\n\nMr. Weinstein has yet to release \u201cDjango Unchained,\u201d a Christmas Day film from Quentin Tarantino (a past Oscar winner, for writing \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d), though awards screenings are promised shortly. And \u201cThe Master,\u201d from Paul Thomas Anderson (with five past nominations), could still shake the race if awards voters tend to agree more with the critics, who loved it, than with the audience, which has largely stayed away since the film\u2019s release in September.\n\nBut Mr. Weinstein and his small company are still in the thick of the fight. Both Mr. Cooper, of \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d and Amy Adams, of \u201cThe Master,\u201d made a show for the cameras, and Oscar voters, on Saturday night.\n\nMr. Tarantino, meanwhile, got face time by delivering a tribute to Mr. Needham, an 81-year-old sharecropper\u2019s son who described having broken more than 50 bones in the making of movies like \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and \u201cLittle Big Man\u201d and who broke down weeping on mentioning his mother.\n\nMr. Pennebaker, famous for documentaries like \u201cThe War Room\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back,\u201d kept speaking while the Governors Awards producers raised the lights up and down in what might have been a signal to cool it. He finally asked the guests if he was getting a bit long. Will Smith, at a front table, shouted \u201cNoooo!,\u201d so he kept going.\n\nJeffrey Katzenberg, the DreamWorks Animation chief executive, received the Jean Hersholt award for his philanthropic efforts and modestly acknowledged that his main contribution was getting other people to give.\n\nBut it was left to Mr. Stevens, the founder of the American Film Institute, to express what those glad-handing studio filmmakers hope is true.\n\n\u201cI have seen a couple of pictures this fall,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I am confident will stand the test of time.\u201d", "summary": "The big studios hope to take top Oscars back from the independents, who have won major awards since 2008.", "density": 1.2857142857000001, "coverage": 0.9047619048000001, "compression": 70.1428571429, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/Time-to-get-mad-before-healing-6594345.php", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20151028015727id_/http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/Time-to-get-mad-before-healing-6594345.php", "title": "After earlier rancor, struggling 49ers could face more", "date": "20151028015727", "text": "Photo: Ben Margot, Associated Press\n\nTeammates have come to the defense of Colin Kaepernick, but he still has detractors in what has become a forgettable season.\n\nTeammates have come to the defense of Colin Kaepernick, but he still has detractors in what has become a forgettable season.\n\nAfter earlier rancor, struggling 49ers could face more\n\nTwo days after a loss to the Packers dropped the 49ers to 1-3, head coach Jim Tomsula and other coaches addressed the team in what he termed a \u201cheated\u201d meeting before they left the room and let the players talk.\n\nTomsula\u2019s departing message to his angry team: It\u2019s OK if lasagna is left littering the locker room.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I said to them was, \u2018Guys, it's like an Italian dining-room table,\u2019\u201d Tomsula said Tuesday on KNBR. \u201c\u2018Everybody\u2019s sitting around the table and sometimes it gets heated, dishes get broken and people leave.

And when it's all said and done, we're hugging and kissing, and we're eating good food again.\u2019\u201d\n\nTomsula put a positive spin on the family spat, which he termed \u201ctruthful\u201d and \u201cproductive.\u201d And it probably helped the locker-room vibe when the 49ers, who had lost their previous three games by 79 points at the time, followed by stringing together respectable performances: a 30-27 road loss to the Giants and a 25-20 win over the Ravens.\n\nHowever, more dish-throwing dinners could be on the horizon.\n\nOn Thursday, the 49ers dropped to 2-5 with a 20-3 loss to the Seahawks that Tomsula and multiple players termed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d On Sunday, Fox Sports\u2019 Jay Glazer reported that quarterback Colin Kaepernick was isolated from his teammates, although he wasn\u2019t disliked: \u201cHe\u2019s just alone, on an island in that locker room,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cThere's not a lot of people he connects with.\u201d\n\nHow will the 49ers respond? Safety Eric Reid hopes they do so calmly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to overreact,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019re 2-5, but we don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel. I don\u2019t think anybody needs to start a yelling-fest, point fingers at anybody. That\u2019s what we don\u2019t need. We have to understand the mistakes we\u2019ve been making and correct them.\u201d\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a shortage of mistakes on a team that ranks 31st in total defense and 32nd in total offense. However, Kaepernick has endured much of the criticism. He ranks 24th in the NFL in passer rating (82.8) and completion percentage (61.4) and the worst two-game stretch of his 46-start career preceded the team meeting this month.\n\nDuring the lively players-only portion of that meeting, a player called out Kaepernick, but another responded by defending the quarterback, CSN Bay Area reported Monday.\n\nOf course, most NFL quarterbacks are expected to help unify the locker room, not be the source of friction. On Tuesday, running back Reggie Bush, 30, a 10-year veteran who signed with the 49ers in March, was asked about Kaepernick\u2019s leadership traits.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hard worker,\u201d Bush said. \u201cHe works really hard. He\u2019s one of the hardest workers I\u2019ve been around, especially in the weight room. He works his butt off. He\u2019s constantly on the field talking to guys and just trying to get better on the field. He\u2019s young, and I think still has a long career left in this game. And, obviously, we\u2019re all struggling. Nobody is playing well on offense. So we can all be better.\u201d\n\nCould Kaepernick communicate better? He has been curt with the media throughout his career, but he\u2019s not standoffish with his teammates when reporters are in the locker room. He recently engaged in a lively table-tennis game with fullback Bruce Miller, a fellow member of the 2011 draft class. Bush insisted the dynamic is positive behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cI see him interact all the time,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI see him always talking to guys. On the football field, he\u2019s always talking to guys and working with guys, and talking and communicating. As far as I\u2019ve seen, he\u2019s doing a great job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to dig up stories and say things when your team is not playing well.

While that debt is not backed by the federal government, it is included in the overall federal debt numbers.\n\nBy selling the TVA, Obama can give the appearance of immediately erasing $25 billion in red ink from the books.\n\nSome are now questioning whether shedding the TVA would yield the kind of payoff Obama anticipates, while Republican lawmakers in the region remain uncharacteristically protective of this government-sponsored company. And ratepayers worry that if the TVA changes hands, their power costs could go up.\n\nEighty years after its creation, this \"federal corporation\" remains popular. It provides electricity to 9 million people through 29 hydro-electric projects, 12 coal plants, three nuclear facilities, 15 natural gas-fired stations and one wind farm. Its rates for electricity are among the lowest in the nation. It is self-sustaining and has not received any federal appropriations since 1959.\n\nSteven Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy questioned whether the federal government would even make much money off the sale.\n\n\"If President Obama's looking for money for the federal treasury, it's not clear that the assets will actually exceed the debt here,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, sources inside the TVA estimate its assets are worth between $10 billion and $15 billion. Add to that another $10 billion in other liabilities like pensions and its worth diminishes even more.\n\n\"It doesn't take you very long to peel the onion to see that the money's not really going to be there,\" Smith said.\n\nIn addition, the TVA spends about $100 million each year to manage the watershed for flood control, erosion, recreation, fish and wildlife. That's a cost the federal government would have to pick up if it unloads the TVA to a private entity.\n\n\"We fund all these recreational water, stewardship activities out of the low rate we charge today,\" said Bill Johnson, the TVA's CEO. \"These would be cost setters that somebody would have to pick up, and I think it would be hard to do more efficiently.\"\n\nRather than erasing federal debt that doesn't really exist, Obama could actually create more if he sells the power company.\n\nPresident Eisenhower once thought about privatizing the TVA, famously calling it \"creeping socialism\". But there is not a lot of appetite in the TVA service area to sell it. Residents like the reliable, low-cost electricity. And they wonder, if it ain't broke, why fix it?\n\nAmong them is Mary Jones, who owns the Tic Toc ice cream parlor in picturesque Loudon, Tenn.\n\n\"All this equipment, our refrigerators, our freezers here even our milkshake machines and our espresso machine -- everything is run by electricity. We need good, economical electricity,\" she told Fox News.\n\nShe fears that if the TVA is privatized, electricity rates would increase, threatening her business.\n\n\"I like it the way it is, thank you,\" she told Fox News. \"I believe that the president needs to just stay away.\"\n\nIn a role reversal, many Republican lawmakers -- usually champions of privatization -- are extremely protective of the TVA. Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander told an Appropriations Committee hearing that just the mention of a possible sale caused TVA bonds to drop in value by a half a billion dollars.\n\n\"I think that somebody with a green eye shade down there in the Office of Management And Budget just thinks it's a cool idea to talk about selling the TVA and we don't appreciate that approach,\" he said. \"It is an ill-conceived, reckless approach.\"\n\nTVA CEO Bill Johnson says it's not hard to see the political value of his utility.\n\n\"You see very reliable economical power. You see that huge recreation and resource management issue -- all of which is done without any support from the taxpayers. So, if you live here, it's really easy and it's easy for your constituents to see what the benefit is,\" he told Fox News.\n\nBut the TVA faces challenges in the future. It is in desperate need of about $25 billion in improvements to meet tighter clean air regulations. It will have to mothball some coal plants and modernize others. And it must do it all while not breaking the statutory debt limit Congress imposed on the TVA -- $30 billion.\n\nJohnson believes the utility can complete the necessary changes while staying under the debt ceiling by leasing back new plants and equipment.\n\n\"Even with the debt cap, the flexibility we have with the alternative financing, I think we're going to be ok here for at least a decade,\" he told Fox News.\n\nOthers aren't so sure. The junior senator from Tennessee, Republican Bob Corker, worries that the TVA is old and mismanaged. He told Fox News that he is open to exploring different ownership of the utility.\n\n\"I think it's losing its competitive edge, and I'd be open to looking at a model that would cause TVA to function at a higher level and be better for taxpayers at the same time,\" he said.", "summary": "In his new budget, President Obama ordered a strategic review of the Tennessee Valley Authority with an eye toward selling it to private interests.", "density": 10.6923076923, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 44.884615384599996, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/sports/baseball/as-bonds-appeals-verdict-jurors-will-be-watching-closely.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2011051619id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/sports/baseball/as-bonds-appeals-verdict-jurors-will-be-watching-closely.html", "title": "As Bonds Appeals Verdict, Jurors Will Be Watching Closely", "date": "2011051619", "text": "Steve Abfalter, a juror in the Barry Bonds trial, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cknowing what I know now, it would be hard to handle if the conviction was thrown out because he was obviously so guilty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarry Bonds\u2019s perjury trial was nearly eight years in the making before he was convicted last month of obstruction of justice in federal court. Yet his case, which has cost both sides millions of dollars and has dragged on since his initial indictment in 2007, is far from over.\n\nAt a hearing in San Francisco on Friday, prosecutors are expected to tell Judge Susan Illston of United States District Court whether they plan to retry Bonds on any of the three counts on which the jury in his trial ended up deadlocked. And by then Bonds\u2019s lawyers should file court papers explaining why they think Illston should overturn Bonds\u2019s conviction.\n\nThe sentencing date for Bonds \u2014 who faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence but will most likely serve much less time than that, if any \u2014 is also scheduled to be set Friday.\n\nWith so many facets left unfinished, the conclusion of the case could take months.\n\nOne group that will be watching how the matter unfolds is the jury that spent nearly four weeks at Bonds\u2019s trial. In recent interviews, some of those jurors said they had spent too much time and energy on the case to ignore what would ultimately happen to Bonds.\n\n\u201cOnce the trial was over, I got on the Internet and saw how much incriminating evidence was out there that we weren\u2019t allowed to see as jurors,\u201d Steve Abfalter, a juror from Antioch, Calif., said. \u201cSo knowing what I know now, it would be hard to handle if the conviction was thrown out because he was obviously so guilty.\u201d\n\nThe jurors \u2014 eight women and four men \u2014 deliberated for four days before deciding that they would never come to a unanimous decision on three of the four counts.\n\nBonds, who hit more home runs (762) than anyone else in Major League Baseball, had been charged with one count of lying to a grand jury in 2003 for saying he never used steroids. The jurors voted, 8 to 4, for his acquittal on that count. They voted, 9 to 3, for his acquittal on another charge that Bonds lied about his suspected use of human growth hormone.\n\nOn a third perjury charge, which claimed that Bonds lied when he said he never was injected by someone other than his doctor, the jury voted, 11 to 1, for his conviction.\n\n\u201cBonds ought to be on his knees thanking God for the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that one juror,\u201d said James Stephens, a juror from Livermore, Calif., who voted to convict Bonds on all charges. He added that the holdout juror had initially voted for conviction on that count during the jury\u2019s deliberations but changed her mind the next day.\n\n\u201cWe did our best as jurors and the government did their best, too, so it should be over,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t retry anything.\u201d\n\nWhile Stephens said he would be upset if Bonds\u2019s single conviction did not stand, other jurors, like Jessica Wolfram, said they would not be surprised if that conviction was thrown out by the judge or by an appeals court.\n\nWolfram, 25, who works with developmentally disabled adults in Concord, Calif., said four of the jurors were unsure of the wording of that charge in the first place.\n\nShe said she and those other jurors noticed that Bonds in his grand jury testimony eventually answered whether Anderson had ever injected him. But he did so a few pages later in his testimony, Wolfram said, not in the section mentioned in the charge. She said she and the other three jurors thought Bonds should not be convicted if he ultimately answered the question.\n\n\u201cBut then we reread the instructions from the judge a hundred times and it said to focus on one underlined statement from Bonds, from his grand jury testimony,\u201d said Wolfram, who voted for Bonds\u2019s conviction on two of the four charges. \u201cIn that part, he avoided answering the question by talking about his dad and his childhood and clearly was parading around the question.

Instead, the Italian system replaces the cold stuff with a long chute of molded plastic that is draped down a mountainside. Riders are pulled up the mountain in inner tubes by the same tow used for snow tubing, but once they get to the top, they barrel down the chute's fake grass.\n\n\"I gotta have a few of those,\" Locher thought. Last year, three of them arrived at Bryce -- the first ever in the United States, so far as Locher knows. Then the mountain manager at nearby Massanutten Resort got a look at them, and late this spring, they arrived on Massanutten Mountain.\n\nNot to be outdone, the folks at Wisp Resort in Western Maryland ordered theirs, which they hope will be up and running in a matter of days.\n\nIt's all part of the never-ending quest -- from tubing on plastic to lifts that carry mountain bikes -- to bring you to area ski resorts long before, and long after, the ski season.\n\n\"The ski resort business is changing,\" explains Deanna Painter, a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania's Liberty Mountain Resort. \"It's very costly to have a lot of land and a big facility, and there has to be a way to attract people all year long.\"\n\nThus the inventions: skiing on grass with tank treads attached to your boots; tobogganing on wheeled sleds; zooming down the mountain on a device that's a cross between a snowboard and in-line skates. And now, the latest, tubing down the mountain.\n\nI decided to try the new tubing ride at Massanutten Resort, whose brochures and Web site promised \"over 125 things to do,\" even before opening what they're calling Peaked Mountain Express.\n\nJust as with snow tubing, my favorite part is the bouncing tow ride up the mountain on an inner tube -- a short but satisfying trip, without being at all scary.\n\nFrom the bottom, the \"express\" doesn't look that imposing, but from the top, the 660-foot slide looks much longer. The vertical drop of 125 feet at the speed of a good ski run provides enough excitement for a couple of screams on the way, and 15 seconds later, it's time for another trip up.\n\nThe ride seems about the same speed, and delivers the same rush, as snow tubing, just without the cold and snow. Two rides, which aren't enough, cost $4, while two hours, which is too much, costs $10. One hour, which also costs $10, was just about right.\n\nIf you're spending, say, 48 hours at the resort, that leaves you another 47. Massanutten has devised all kinds of ways to fill those hours.\n\nThe two 13-year-old girls I'd brought along and I considered tubing the river, but a torrential downpour drove us inside the massive water park on the resort grounds.

Richard Adams emigrated from the Philippines as a child and became an American citizen. The two met in Los Angeles, fell in love and got married in Boulder, Colorado -- long before any state legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nCounty Clerk Clela Rorex issued the gay couple a marriage license at 11 a.m., April 21, 1975.\n\nNothing in the Colorado marriage code mentioned same-sex marriage, and Rorex signed licenses for six couples before the district attorney advised her to end to them. But the licenses were never rescinded.\n\nSullivan and Adams believed their marriage was legal and embarked on a decades-long struggle to attain permanent resident status for Sullivan.\n\nThey became the first gay couple to sue the federal government for recognition of their marriage, effectively launching a movement that helped lead to the Supreme Court's ruling a year ago that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman.\n\nSullivan and Adams filed the first lawsuit that sought recognition for a same-sex marriage.\n\nAdams (left) and Sullivan were one of six same-sex couples who were married in Boulder, Colorado, in 1975.\n\nClerk Clela Rorex issued Adams and Sullivan a marriage license. It was never rescinded.\n\nThe Justice Department's denial of the immigration petition contained derogatory language.\n\nBut even now, a year after that historic ruling, Sullivan, 72, remains in America, undocumented.\n\nIn April, he filed a motion for the government to reopen his case and grant him a green card.\n\nFederal immigration law says a U.S. citizen or green card holder can sponsor a spouse so that they can remain together in America. But because of DOMA, the law did not afford that right to binational gay couples.\n\nAfter DOMA's demise, about 40,000 such couples became eligible for immigration rights. Previously, they were forced to choose between love and country -- and many of them lived in exile to be together.\n\n\"The DOMA ruling completely changed the landscape,\" said Michael Sisitzky, an attorney with Immigration Equality, an organization that has been working with same-sex binational couples for two decades.\n\nIt was a watershed moment, and within one week of the ruling, Immigration Equality heard from 1,500 couples seeking help. That's more than the total number of inquiries the group got the year before, Sisitzky said.\n\n\"It was as if a light switch had gone off,\" he said. \"LGBT couples go through the same process now as straight couples.\"\n\nA year after DOMA, these couples choose both love and country\n\nHowever, some people, like Sullivan, have been left behind, said his attorney, Lavi Soloway, a gay rights lawyer who helped found Immigration Equality.\n\nSix months before the DOMA ruling, Sullivan's spouse died. Soloway said gay and lesbian widows and widowers are fighting to get their marriages recognized even though they no longer have a spouse who can sponsor them for a visa.\n\nSullivan hopes that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service will allow him to live in the United States, as he has done for the past 40 years, legally.\n\n\"Common sense says that my petition should be accepted. Decency also says it should be accepted,\" Sullivan said. \"At the moment, I am just living my life day to day. \"\n\nA license and a letter\n\nAt 29, Sullivan left home in Sydney, Australia, and was in the middle of an around-the-world trip when he stumbled upon Adams at a gay bar called The Closet in Los Angeles. It was Cinco de Mayo, 1971.\n\nThe two agreed to meet for a date the next day at Greta Garbo's star on Hollywood Boulevard. Soon after, they knew they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.\n\nBut Sullivan was on a tourist visa in the United States. He was not permitted to work. He would have to leave the country when his visa expired. They began to think about ways they could stay together.\n\nThere was no country in the world then that allowed immigration rights for same-sex partners, nowhere they could go. Sullivan remained in the country -- illegally.\n\nThen, on television one day, they heard the most incredible news: a Colorado clerk had issued a marriage license to two men. Sullivan and Adams immediately made plans to fly to Boulder.\n\nRorex, the Boulder County clerk, was 31, wore her skirts short and her hair long. She'd joined the National Organization for Women and was swept up in the movement for equal rights. She surprised even herself by winning the clerk's race.\n\nShe'd been on the job only three months when a couple from Colorado Springs -- David McCord and David Zamora -- showed up wanting to get married. After she learned from the district attorney that nothing in the marriage code referred to gay marriages as illegal, Rorex granted the two men their wish.\n\nShe did not know any gay people; she'd grown up in the small town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, before it became a skiing haven. Her world was pretty insular.\n\nBut she felt in her gut it was the right thing to do.\n\nSullivan and Adams showed up in Boulder, got a license and then were married in a church that supported gay rights. The first thing Adams did when they returned to Los Angeles was to petition what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for permanent residency or a green card for Sullivan.\n\nThey could finally envision a future together in the United States.\n\nBut suddenly, after their marriage made headlines, their private lives had become very public. Newspapers ran stories about them. Phil Donahue invited them on his daytime TV talk show.\n\nSoon, they began to feel the sting of homophobia.\n\nSullivan's mother wrote him a letter disowning him. \"Perversion is bad enough,\" she wrote, \"but public display, never. ... I can endure no more.\"\n\nA woman in the audience of \"Donahue\" told Sullivan: \"I think we should give you a lottery ticket and send you back to where you came from.\"\n\nWorst of all was a letter from the Department of Justice that arrived in the mail in November 1975. It contained only one sentence explaining a denial of a green card: \"You have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots.\"\n\nThe INS followed up with a second letter that said the green card petition was denied on the grounds that neither party was able to perform female functions in a marriage.\n\nIt was inconceivable to Sullivan and Adams that anyone in government would use such language, especially that other \"f\" word. They filed the first lawsuit in America that sought recognition from the federal government for a same-sex marriage.\n\nBut after years of legal wrangling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the couple in 1985. The opinion, written by future Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, affirmed that marriage was between a man and a woman.\n\nSullivan and Adams had lost. They tried to appeal to the Supreme Court but the justices refused to hear their case.\n\nI should be allowed to continue my life here even though it's in a state of widowerhood.Anthony Sullivan\n\nSullivan had exhausted every avenue available to him. He had a limited number of days left to voluntarily leave America before authorities would deport him to Australia.\n\nIf he and Adams wanted to remain together, they had no choice but to leave the country. They felt like refugees because of their sexual orientation. There still wasn't any nation that recognized same-sex marriages, so Sullivan and Adams headed for Europe, where they had friends.\n\nThey boarded TWA Flight 760 for London, leaving everything behind. For Adams, it was especially painful to separate from his mother and sisters.\n\nThe couple floated around Europe like paupers for 11 months and eventually got fed up and returned to the United States by way of Mexico. Back then, crossing the border was easier, and Sullivan got through by passing as an American.\n\nSullivan resumed life in Los Angeles under the radar of immigration authorities. In a way, it was a relief to live in hiding, away from the spotlight.\n\nIn other ways it was painful. Sullivan's mother and brother died. Without documents, he could not travel and attend their funerals in Australia.\n\nThe couple also had returned to an America reeling from the AIDS epidemic. They watched their friends get sick and die.\n\nThey lived quietly, all the time fearing that Sullivan could, at any moment, get picked up by immigration agents.\n\nIn 2010, Adams was diagnosed with lung cancer. By then the gay rights movement had gained momentum and it seemed as though states were falling like dominoes on the question of same-sex marriage.\n\nSoloway, the couple's lawyer, knew there was a chance the Supreme Court would strike down DOMA. That's what he told Sullivan and Adams when he visited them on December 15 and encouraged them to go to Washington state and get married there -- just in case the government refused to recognize their Colorado license.\n\nSullivan and his attorney, Lavi Soloway, filed a petition in April asking immigration authorities to reconsider his case.\n\nThey decided to marry again, except they would see it as an affirmation ceremony. Instead of \"death do us part,\" they planned to say, \"as long as there is love.\"\n\nThey never made it to Washington. Adams died the next day. He was 65.\n\nSeveral newspapers ran his obituary. He and Sullivan were, after all, pioneers in the struggle for gay rights in America.\n\nWhen DOMA was struck down a year ago on June 26, Sullivan watched the news with his dog Jasper. He thought it ironic that Kennedy was the swing vote. In Sullivan's eyes, the justice had redeemed himself for the decision he'd handed down all those years ago.\n\nThe ruling was a victory for gay couples but bittersweet for Sullivan. He wished Adams were there by his side to witness history.\n\n\"It was a grave injustice he didn't live to see that day,\" Sullivan said.\n\nWhen Adams died, Sullivan's first inclination was to walk away from it all, to return to Australia. But he realized that America was home now. That's why he has asked immigration authorities to reconsider his petition for permanent residency.\n\n\"I should be allowed to continue my life here,\" he said, \"even though it's in a state of widowerhood.\"\n\nRecently, he attended the premier of a new documentary, \"Limited Partnership,\" which chronicles his relationship with Adams and his battle to gain permanent residency. It will be shown in San Francisco on the first anniversary of the DOMA ruling.\n\nIt was tough for Sullivan to sit through the film and see himself on the big screen.

One is the city planning department\u2019s Special Downtown Brooklyn District, bounded roughly by Tillary Street on the north, Atlantic Avenue on the south, Clinton Street on the west and a jagged eastern border including Ashland Place. But some consider parts of the district Brooklyn Heights, Boerum Hill or Fort Greene.\n\nThe neighborhood has converted prewar office buildings like 110 Livingston, the Beaux-Arts former home of the New York City Board of Education, and now a condominium; and BellTel Lofts at 365 Bridge Street, with 250 condo units in an Art Deco building that once housed the New York Telephone Company. But the area is being redefined by new apartment towers like the 53-story Ashland; the 58-story building that houses AVA DoBro and the Avalon Willoughby Square; the 35-story 300 Ashland; and the 32-story 461 Dean.\n\nThe median sales price for condos through October was $1.14 million, down slightly from $1.15 million at the same time last year, when sales of new condos at 388 Bridge were robust, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. In 2011, the median for condos was $637,500. For co-ops, the median was $782,000 through October, compared with $727,212 in 2015 and $599,000 in 2011.\n\nThere were 61 properties for sale on Nov. 21 in the Special Downtown Brooklyn District, according to data compiled by StreetEasy.com, though some are listed as being in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn Heights or Fort Greene by real estate agents or developers. They ranged from a studio for $450,000 to a townhouse for $4,750,000.\n\nThe average monthly rent for a one-bedroom was $3,196 at the end of October, the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership said.\n\nResidents walk to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for performances, films and talks and to the Barclays Center to see the Brooklyn Nets play basketball and the New York Islanders hockey, as well as concerts.\n\nOn weekdays, streets teem with workers, including 22,000 people at MetroTech Center\u2019s 11 buildings, and some 60,000 college students attending 11institutions.\n\nThe neighborhood\u2019s historic anchors include the mid-19th century Greek Revival Borough Hall (where there is a farmers market on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays) and 66-year-old Junior\u2019s, a sprawling restaurant famous for its cheesecake.\n\nThe pedestrian-oriented blocks known as Fulton Mall have stores ranging from old-style cosmetics-and-wig shops to Macy\u2019s and a new Century 21 department store. DeKalb Market Hall, set to open nearby in March, will have 40 vendors; the Gotham Market at the Ashland, scheduled to open in January, eight places to drink and dine.\n\nPublic School 287 Bailey K. Ashford has about 200 students in prekindergarten through Grade 5; the city\u2019s 2015-16 School Quality Snapshot says 12 percent met state standards in English, versus 39 percent citywide, and 16 percent in math, compared with 40 percent. P.S. 20 Clinton Hill has about 410 students in pre-K through Grade 5; 39 percent met state standards in English and 39 percent in math.\n\nP.S. 261 Philip Livingston has about 780 students in pre-K through fifth grade; 53 percent met state standards in English and 57 percent in math.

But until last month a home-produced version of the police procedural, that staple of American television, was nowhere to be found.\n\nOld as the formula is, it\u2019s sturdy and travels well. Upright officers \u2014 whether in Britain, Sweden or Spain \u2014 gather evidence, question witnesses and mostly get their man (or woman). Even Russia has its own remake of \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d In Mexico, though, the idea of a police protagonist with integrity poses such a dramatic disconnect from most Mexicans\u2019 reality that a standard precinct drama had long seemed out of reach.\n\nBut in May the Mexican incarnation finally arrived. The show, \u201cEl Equipo\u201d (\u201cThe Team\u201d), does not try to resolve the contradiction between what citizens here think of their police \u2014 incompetent at best, criminal collaborators at worst \u2014 and a sympathetic portrayal on screen. Instead it opts for \u201c24\u201d-style bluster. The show turns on the exploits of the members of an elite crime-fighting team so heroic that its members don\u2019t even need last names.\n\nThe team\u2019s work is split between action-packed \u201coperativos\u201d and time spent tapping on computers in what is supposed to be the Mexican federal police intelligence center but which looks more like a neon-lighted conference room in a 1960s Acapulco hotel, only with much snazzier electronics.\n\n\u201cIf there is a message we wanted to transmit, it\u2019s that inside the police forces there is technology, there is intelligence, there are committed men, people of flesh and blood who go to work every day,\u201d said Pedro Torres, who produced the series for Televisa, Mexico\u2019s dominant broadcaster. \u201cI think there are many heroes and many very honest people inside the federal police.\u201d\n\nThe series, which ran every weeknight for three weeks, will be broadcast on the Spanish-language American network Univision beginning Thursday. No decision has been made on a second season.\n\nAs soon as the series began here, it collided with the real-life politics of Mexico\u2019s fight against drug traffickers. One of the centerpieces of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s strategy against organized crime is the creation of an effective national police to take over from the military. The man in charge of building the federal police, Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, the secretary of public security, has become a polarizing figure in the drug war as the death toll mounts and violence spreads to states that were formerly peaceful.\n\nThe Mexican press immediately branded \u201cEl Equipo\u201d an infomercial for the federal police, which gave Mr. Torres extensive access to its facilities as he filmed. Legislators in Congress demanded that Mr. Garc\u00eda Luna give an accounting of how much police money was spent to support the filming and how many hours real officers spent working as extras.\n\nMr. Garc\u00eda Luna does enjoy the theatrical side of his job. In one famous case in 2005, when he was the federal police chief, he admitted to staging the arrest of an alleged kidnapping ring so morning news broadcasts could show a \u201clive\u201d police action. And after the arrest last year of a top cartel operator, Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as La Barbie, the public security ministry circulated DVDs of the interrogation. It made for riveting television but did nothing to help the legal investigation.\n\nIn security circles it was an open secret that Mr. Garc\u00eda Luna wanted to see a police show on television modeled after a long-running series in Spain, \u201cEl Comisario\u201d (\u201cThe Commissioner\u201d). But Mr. Torres, the producer, said the impetus for \u201cEl Equipo\u201d came from his own company. A declared police-drama fanatic, Mr. Torres said he wanted to break from the soap operas that dominate Mexican prime time.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a made-to-order series,\u201d he said, in response to the infomercial charges. \u201cBut we said from the start that this series wouldn\u2019t see the light of day without the decided and decisive support of the federal police. We wanted to see their installations. We wanted to have access to their different equipment, like their helicopters, their squad cars, their weaponry. We wanted it to be an American-style series where you see real squad cars, real helicopters, etc. etc.\u201d", "summary": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cEl Equipo\u00e2\u0080\u009d (\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Team\u00e2\u0080\u009d), Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first American-style police procedural, poses a dramatic disconnect from the experience of most Mexicans.", "density": 1.7307692308, "coverage": 0.7307692308, "compression": 35.8076923077, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/09/12/conservatives-fight-marijuana-taxation-despite-giggle-factor/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2013091219id_/http://swampland.time.com/2013/09/12/conservatives-fight-marijuana-taxation-despite-giggle-factor/", "title": "Conservatives Fight Marijuana Taxation Despite \u201cGiggle Factor\u201d", "date": "2013091219", "text": "<> on September 12, 2013 in Washington, DC.\n\nIn front of the U.S. Capitol Thursday, two congressmen discussed H.R. 2240, the Small Business Tax Equity Act, a little known bill introduced in June by Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer to allow deductions and credits relating to expenditures for marijuana sales conducted in compliance with state law.\n\nThe bill, according to GovTrack.Us, has a 0% chance of being enacted and has a tiny chance of even getting out of the House Ways and Means committee. The main reason it has reached national attention is Grover Norquist, the President of Americans for Tax Reform, who has corralled 219 Representatives and 39 Senators to pledge to oppose any and all tax increases. He has taken up the no-tax-penalty-for-pot cause. Norquist\u2014who has \u201cNo, absolutely not\u201d ever smoked the stuff\u2014believes that federal encroachment on the nascent field of state regulation of marijuana is a deeply serious topic, irrespective of the drug\u2019s effects.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a slight giggle factor on the issue dealing with marijuana,\u201d says Norquist. \u201cThat said, this is tax policy, this is real stuff. This is important. This is everything from jobs to whether the federal government comes in and writes rules that upsets the apple cart in many, many different states.\u201d\n\nThe fact that taxing marijuana has become an issue of debate is a sign of the success of cannabis advocates. In August, the Administration said it would not challenge laws legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington, so long as the they implement \u201cstrong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana,\u201d according to a Justice Dept. memo. Marijuana is still, however, illegal under U.S. federal law.\n\nNorquist, who says the \u201cdouble taxation\u201d of marijuana dispensaries received his attention a couple of months ago, says the legal issue should be decided state by state, but as a tax issue there should be no doubt: legal cannabis dispensaries should be able to claim the expense deductions that any other legal business can claim. \u201dIn Colorado and some of these other states, marijuana dispensaries are just legal businesses. They should be treated that way. But federal law makes that difficult to impossible,\u201d says Norquist. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take the IRS out of this issue.\u201d\n\nThe press briefing, sponsored by National Cannabis Industry Association, also featured Blumenauer and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican. Blumenauer believes that this issue could be a stepping stone for a greater goal: comprehensive tax reform. \u201dI think comprehensive tax reform is not something that is beyond our reach, but it is a heavy lift,\u201d says Blumenauer. \u201cIt would be nice to do a little momentum building, and have people work together on things that are common sense and have bipartisan support. And this is a classic example.\u201d\n\nWhile Blumenauer believes this is a \u201csimple fix,\u201d he admits that it could be awhile before a business can claim a tax deduction in its sale of marijuana. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing first is building the understanding of this issue and its support,\u201d says Blumenauer. \u201cBut I think that this is a perfect item that can be dropped into any tax vehicle going forward.\u201d", "summary": "In front of the U.S. Capitol Thursday, two congressmen discussed H.R. 2240, the Small Business Tax Equity Act, a little known bill introduced in June by Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer to\u00a0allow deductions and credits relating to expenditures for marijuana sales conducted in compliance with state la...", "density": 26.557692307700002, "coverage": 0.9423076923, "compression": 12.3846153846, "compression_bin": "low", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/travel/restaurant-report-la-buvette-in-paris.html", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160727201620id_/http://www.nytimes.com:80/2013/07/28/travel/restaurant-report-la-buvette-in-paris.html?", "title": "Restaurant Report: La Buvette in Paris", "date": "20160727201620", "text": "La Buvette is a one-woman show.

She selects wines, fills glasses, assembles plates of food and cleans up after the tastefully tousled young things who crowd the brightly lighted room every night.\n\nShe makes it look easy. Until Ms. Fourmont, 29, opened La Buvette over the winter in a former cheese shop, she was behind the bar at Le Dauphin, the spot the chef I\u00f1aki Aizpitarte opened once fame made it impossible to get a table at Le Chateaubriand, his restaurant next door. For almost two years, she was a cooling presence at the center of that white-hot scene.\n\nNow Ms. Fourmont has a stage all to herself. She favors obscure wines that don\u2019t cost a lot, cult bottles from unorthodox vintners whose labels often look like arty liner notes. Haven\u2019t heard of Julien Courtois or Marcel Joubert? You\u2019ll need some guidance, which is why she\u2019s there.\n\nAsk for a crisp white with a little funk and she might steer you to Murmure, a rustic muscat from Jean-Pierre Rietsch that stands up to decanting. \u201cI fell in love with this little muscat last week,\u201d Ms. Fourmont said in her accented English during a recent visit. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, and very honest, and very pure. The kind of wine I really like for this place.\u201d\n\nThe food is also simple and honest. White beans are doused in new-harvest olive oil from the specialty shop La T\u00eate Dans les Olives and garnished with chive and garlic blossoms; pata negra ham is cut on a hand-cranked slicer in back.\n\nOn another summer evening, the most complicated dish was wild asparagus, the grassy stalks sprinkled with lemon zest and Parmesan. Dessert choices included fresh ricotta with strawberries and rhubarb jam, or a chocolate \u00e9clair.\n\nIt\u2019s just enough to get you through to the next strange bottle, or to the end of the night.

Citing a police report, WFLA-NBC8 reported that Tarver is being held without bond on an insufficient check and theft charges filed by law enforcement officials in Clark County, Nevada.\n\nLas Vegas is in Clark County.\n\nAccording to WFLA, Clark County records show that charges were first filed against Tarver in June 2013.\n\nTMZ reported that Tarver was initially pulled over in Florida for a possible \"routine tag violation,\" and that the warrant stems from a failure by Tarver to appear in court. TMZ later reported that Wynn Casino in Las Vegas alleges Tarver owes an unpaid gambling marker, which is the root of the legal issues.\n\nPolice mugshot of Antonio Tarver.\n\nTarver, 45, has a career record of 29-6. He exploded onto the amateur scene in the mid-1990s, winning gold at the 1995 World Amateur Championships and Pan American Games before taking bronze at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nMore than six years after turning pro, Tarver won his first major professional world championships, defeating Montel Griffin for the WBC & IBF light heavyweight titles. Tarver also faced Roy Jones Jr. three times in one of modern boxing's most famed trilogies. After losing the first fight on a controversial decision in 2003, Tarver beat Jones in 2004 in one of boxing's greatest upsets, and then won the rubber match by unanimous decision in 2005.\n\nTarver's most notable mainstream fame came not in the squared circle but on the big screen, when he starred as Mason \"The Line\" Dixon in 2006's \"Rocky Balboa.\"\n\nAccording to the reports, Tarver remains jailed in Florida.", "summary": "Ex-world champ Antonio Tarver reportedly arrested in Florida on fugitive warrant, charged with writing bad checks in Nevada at Wynn Casino.", "density": 1.8399999999999999, "coverage": 0.72, "compression": 16.84, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/28/africa/tunisia-terror-attack/index.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015062819id_/http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/28/africa/tunisia-terror-attack/index.html", "title": "Tunisia attack: Hotel shooting survivors tell of horror", "date": "2015062819", "text": "Callaghan was one of at least 39 people injured when a gunman opened fire at the beachfront Hotel Riu Imperial Marhaba in the coastal city of Sousse. At least 38 more were killed in the attack, for which ISIS has claimed responsibility.\n\nSpeaking from her hospital bed, Callaghan told CNN she couldn't believe the terrible events unfolding around her on Friday.\n\n\"My right leg was laying across my stomach,\" she said, still visibly shaken.\n\nBut despite her own horrific injury, Callaghan said she knows she was lucky. A woman next to her in the panicked crowd was shot four times.\n\n\"This lady was bleeding so heavily. And I was laying in her blood trying to keep her awake,\" she said. \"It was dreadful. I've never witnessed anything like it.\"\n\nTunisia attack: Tourism industry reels again\n\nIn another room, Ukrainian Nadezhda Vasilevna, 76, also lies injured. Like many of those in the hospital, she is still wearing the bracelet that identifies her as a guest of the Imperial Marhaba Hotel. Doctors said they removed grenade fragments from her thigh.\n\n\"My husband went to swim, and I was lying and reading the newspaper by the sea. Suddenly I heard an explosion,\" she said.\n\n\"I saw the man running and shooting. He shot at us. For those who moved, he fired again. I looked where he pointed the gun. When he aimed the weapon in my side, I felt a kick. The bullet went right through my soft tissues.\"\n\nShe tied a towel around her leg and tried to hide in the sand, watching stunned as the gunman continued to fire.\n\n\"I was lucky,\" Vasilevna said. \"I had no fear. It was like a movie. I just watched him and tried to deceive him. I just lost a lot of blood.\"\n\nMeantime, Vasilevna's husband, Igor Vladimirovich, 78, watched the attack in horror from the water where he had been swimming. \"The terrorist fired almost without stopping. He moved quickly,\" he said.\n\nIt was the couple's second trip to Tunisia.\n\nTunisia, France, Kuwait: What did attackers hope to achieve?\n\nBelgian Claude Pesser said he was very close to the gunman but remembers little about him -- he was just too scared.\n\nAn X-ray image clearly shows the bullet that struck Pesser's leg, cutting him down as he tried to run to safety.\n\nPesser said he usually travels to Tunisia twice a year -- but no more.\n\nHe expressed sorrow for his Tunisian friends, who he said are good people. But he said the situation in the country is now too dangerous, and he thinks it will stay that way for a long time.\n\nThousands of tourists have been fleeing Sousse since the attack. On Sunday, a spokeswoman for Riu hotels said around 40 tourists remained at the Imperial Marhaba and that the company intended to keep the hotel open.\n\nTunisia's tourism industry had been beginning to recover since the 2011 Arab Spring, but the attack in Sousse -- coming just three months after an attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis -- is likely to deal it yet another blow.\n\nAbout 1,000 armed security officers will be deployed inside and outside tourist zones in Tunisia as of July 1, the Ministry of Tourism and Handicrafts announced Sunday, according to Tunisia state news agency TAP.\n\nOn Saturday night, a large crowd of Tunisians turned out at the hotel in a display of unity after the attacks. They chanted and sang, waved the red and white Tunisian flag and lit candles at the spot where the dozens of victims had been shot the day before.\n\nISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it is unclear if the Islamist group had any direct role in it.\n\nISIS has posted a photo of the alleged attacker, whom Tunisian authorities have identified as Saif Al-Deen Al Rezgui, 24, from the town of Gaafour, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Sousse.\n\nInitial reports Friday about the attack suggested there had been three gunmen, but a Tunisian Interior Ministry spokesman later said the ministry was aware of only one and that he had been killed.\n\nThe spokesman, Mohammed Ali Aroui, told CNN on Saturday that the gunman specialized in electronics in pursuing his masters degree and didn't have any known relationship with a terror group.\n\nTunisian authorities on Saturday began transferring the bodies from Sousse to the capital, Tunis, the Ministry of Health said. It updated the death toll to 38 and said 39 people were wounded.\n\n\"The nationalities of the killed, most of them are British, German, and French, this is the 95% of them,\" according to Prime Minister Habib Essid. \"The majority of them are British, then the second in number were German, then third in numbers were French.\"\n\nFifteen of the dozens killed were British, and the number may rise, the UK Foreign Office said.\n\nWhile Tunisian citizens were wounded in the attack, \"we affirm that there is no Tunisian (among the dead),\" Tunis Prosecutor Sofiene Selliti said, according to TAP.\n\nOne Belgian, one German and three Irish citizens were also among the dead. Ireland's Foreign Ministry confirmed the death of Lorna Carty on Saturday, while the mayor of Athone on Sunday said a couple from the Irish town -- Laurence and Martina Hayes -- had also died. It is not yet clear whether they were killed immediately or died later from their wounds.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi on Saturday, a German government spokesman said. Merkel expressed her condolences, the spokesman said, and both leaders agreed to cooperate more closely on the issue of terrorism.\n\nIn the wake of the resort attack, Essid announced a crackdown on what he called \"illegal mosques.\"\n\nThe mosques were \"spreading rumors and poisons to encourage terrorism,\" he said Saturday. \"About 80 (mosques) will be closed ... within one week.\"\n\nTunisia's nightmare came the same day as two fatal terrorist attacks in other countries.\n\nA man caused an explosion at a chemical plant near Lyon in southeastern France after having beheaded his boss and leaving the head hanging on a fence, French officials said. Authorities detained the suspect.\n\nAnd ISIS claimed responsibility for an apparent bomb blast at the Shiite-affiliated Al-Sadiq mosque in Kuwait's capital during Friday prayers, leaving at least 27 dead and more than 200 wounded.\n\nTunisia's TAP said Sunday that an emergency Arab League meeting will take place Monday at the request of Kuwait, \"to examine the repercussion of the latest terrorist attacks in Tunisia and in Kuwait.\"\n\nThe permanent members of the league will discuss \"training of joint Arab forces against the terrorist organizations,\" mainly ISIS, said TAP, citing the Arab League Deputy Secretary-General of International Political Affairs Fadhel Jaoued.\n\nCNN's Phil Black reported from Sousse, Laura Smith-Spark and Susannah Cullinane from London.

As head of a scrappy start-up going up against financial behemoths to get Hollywood deals, Mr. Bannon showed the fierce competitiveness that would later drive his politics.\n\n\u201cWe were the underdog,\u201d Mr. Vorse said. \u201cWe were competing for the business of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and we did well.\u201d Mr. Vorse said Bannon & Co. represented the Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; the Italian media tycoon and later the prime minister Silvio Berlusconi; Samsung; Westinghouse; and other big players.\n\nMr. Vorse was the detail man, he said. Mr. Bannon \u201cwas the visionary, seeing things before anyone else. He was the rainmaker. He was a leader.\u201d\n\nEven as they became successful, Mr. Bannon was not a lavish spender. \u201cHe was driving an eight-year-old Celica convertible,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Bannon appears to have gone through some lean moments in the 1990s \u2014 court records show five federal and four state tax liens for amounts from $10,993 to $136,610. Ms. Jones, his film collaborator, said that when Mr. Bannon and his second wife, Mary Louise Piccard, separated, he lived for a time in a spare room at the home of his first wife, Cathleen Houff Jordan. Ms. Piccard had accused Mr. Bannon of grabbing her wrist and neck during an argument, an allegation he denied.\n\nBut in 1993, as part of the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to Turner Broadcasting System, he acquired a share of the royalties from \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d a move that would prove extremely lucrative as the show became a cultural force.\n\nIn 1998, Bannon & Co. was acquired by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and Mr. Bannon ran a series of companies working at the intersection of entertainment and finance.\n\n\u201cVery intense, very passionate,\u201d said Trevor Drinkwater, who worked with him in film distribution from 2004 to 2010. \u201cI was impressed that while he was very right wing, he had a lot of liberal friends.\u201d He saw Mr. Bannon\u2019s dress evolve toward the casual, \u201cthe flannel shirt over the polo shirt.\u201d\n\nThrough films, Mr. Bannon was turning his attention back to politics. Tim Watkins, his co-director on the Reagan documentary, said Mr. Bannon worked from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to, say, go to a ballgame,\u201d he said. But Mr. Watkins found his collaborator\u2019s combativeness wearying.\n\n\u201cSteve thinks everything has to be a fight,\u201d he said. Once, an argument broke out when he told Mr. Bannon that the rough cut of the film, at two hours and 10 minutes, should be trimmed further. Angry, Mr. Bannon \u201cactually flipped over the table,\u201d Mr. Watkins said.\n\nAt first, he recalled, before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, they intended to make a standard biopic. But the attacks \u201cchanged the film radically,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War battles merged with the coda, which showed the hijacked airliners hitting the World Trade Center and people jumping to their deaths.\n\n\u201cSteve crafted a lot of the big ideas,\u201d Mr. Watkins said, notably that \u201clife is a battle of good and evil, and history repeats itself.\u201d\n\nLou Cannon, a Reagan biographer, rejects comparisons of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Trump. He notes that Mr. Reagan had been governor of California before becoming president, never demonized opponents and signed a law giving amnesty to three million undocumented immigrants. Nonetheless, Mr. Watkins sees striking similarities and is sure Mr. Bannon does, too. In the Reagan memorabilia he accumulated while working on the film, Mr. Watkins said, he recently found some lapel stickers.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again,\u201d they read.\n\nWhen his eldest child, Maureen, got into West Point, Mr. Bannon was thrilled and joked about switching his allegiance to Army from Navy. He never missed her volleyball games, and he was at Fort Campbell, Ky., in 2011 when she returned from a deployment to Iraq. \u201cThat was one of the greatest feelings I\u2019ve had, seeing my dad when I walked off the plane,\u201d she said.\n\nBut through his daughter\u2019s service, he saw an inequity that fueled his anger at the privileged Americans among whom he had long worked.\n\nAt West Point, \u201che saw a complete, utter lack of people from the upper economic levels of American society,\u201d said Mr. Schweizer, the conservative writer. \u201cHe thought it was appalling, especially because the elite set so many policies that sent these kids into war.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon was put off by the George W. Bush administration\u2019s creation in 2003 of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, which he saw as a blatant giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies. The financial collapse of 2008 and the bailouts that followed infuriated him, including the devastating effect of the stock market collapse on the retirement accounts of men like his father, a phone company retiree.\n\nMr. Bannon often spoke to friends about his father\u2019s \u201chonest work,\u201d contrasting it with the paper-pushing he had seen on Wall Street. \u201cWe consider ourselves middle class, and we think the middle class has been shafted,\u201d Mike Bannon said. \u201cBlack, Hispanic, white, everybody. The political class has given them happy talk but delivered nothing. I think that\u2019s what Steve\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nBy the time of a Tea Party gathering in 2010 in New York, Steve Bannon had fully embraced a class-based diagnosis of the country\u2019s woes: \u201cIn the last 20 years, our financial elites and the political class have taken care of themselves and led our country to the brink of ruin,\u201d he said. By contrast, he said, the Tea Party was backed by \u201cthe people who fight our wars, pay our taxes, run our civic organizations, who build our cities and who hold our neighborhoods together.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon honed his message as he reached out to politicians, beginning with his films about Mrs. Bachmann and Ms. Palin. He criticized the conservative elite, including some of his former business colleagues. \u201cThe reason I made these films is my buddies on Wall Street said, \u2018These women are a bunch of bimbos,\u2019\u201d he told a 2011 gathering. \u201cI said, \u2018I know Governor Palin and Congresswoman Bachmann \u2014 they\u2019re every bit as tough and smart as you guys are.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt times, Mr. Bannon\u2019s rants against the ruling class \u2014 in which he is at least as unsparing of Republicans as of Democrats \u2014 strikingly echo populists on the left. In a revealing 2014 talk via Skype to a Vatican conference, some of his words might have come from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Mr. Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\u201cNot one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with the 2008 crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon fumed. \u201cAnd in fact, it gets worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken.\u201d\n\nBut if his scathing economic analysis sometimes seemed to dabble in Marxism, on other subjects, including race and religion, he made no concessions to political sensitivities. After Mr. Bannon met Mr. Breitbart at the 2004 screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d the two men hit it off, bonding over their similar views and a common irreverent streak.\n\nMs. Jones, the film colleague, said that in their years working together, Mr. Bannon occasionally talked about the genetic superiority of some people and once mused about the desirability of limiting the vote to property owners.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018That would exclude a lot of African-Americans,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jones recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing.\u2019 I said, \u2018But what about Wendy?\u2019\u201d referring to Mr. Bannon\u2019s executive assistant. \u201cHe said, \u2018She\u2019s different. She\u2019s family.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon\u2019s African-American friend from his Goldman years said that he had been at pains to defend him in recent years to mutual acquaintances put off first by Breitbart\u2019s reputation and now by Mr. Bannon\u2019s association with Mr. Trump. Most Christmas seasons over the past two decades, he said, Mr. Bannon was \u201cmy only token white guy,\u201d or one of two or three, invited to an annual dinner at a New York City club for nearly a score of African-American friends who work or worked in finance.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m getting a lot of, \u2018What happened to Steve?\u2019\u201d from concerned black acquaintances, the friend said. He said he hoped Mr. Bannon \u2014 and more important, Mr. Trump \u2014 would more forthrightly denounce the bigots who have cheered them on. Still, he said, he completely rejects the accusations against Mr. Bannon.\n\n\u201cHell, no, he\u2019s not a white nationalist,\u201d the friend said.\n\nMr. Bannon took over as executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 after Mr. Breitbart died, playing a hands-on role in assigning, approving and sometimes dictating changes to articles, according to several former Breitbart employees. Staff members grew polarized for or against him. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nThey describe a decentralized operation overseen by Mr. Bannon in two conference calls a day. Employees rarely had any idea where their peripatetic boss was because he seemed to be constantly moving between homes, offices or borrowed premises in Florida, Washington, New York and occasionally Los Angeles or London.\n\nMr. Bannon\u2019s critics assert that he sometimes put his political preferences ahead of fairness or even of the facts, directing that stories be rewritten to his specifications and shrugging off protests that his changes might make them inaccurate. While Breitbart did not traffic in outright racial slurs, it specialized in inflammatory coverage of police shootings, immigration and Islam in ways intended to prick liberal pieties.\n\nAlex Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart, denied that Mr. Bannon ever deliberately permitted an inaccurate story to run on the site. \u201cBreitbart represents certain values, like conservatism, populism and nationalism, and Steve Bannon wanted our content to reflect that,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. He said the site has 45 million readers and should not be judged by \u201ca couple thousand people on Twitter\u201d who express offensive views.\n\nIn 2011, as Mr. Trump pondered a 2012 presidential run, David Bossie, a conservative activist who headed Citizens United, took Mr. Bannon to Trump Tower in New York to meet him. \u201cThey definitely hit it off,\u201d said Mr. Bossie, who has collaborated with Mr. Bannon on a series of films.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Bannon had in common a willingness to defy some small-government conservative notions \u2014 for instance, by pushing for a large, costly infrastructure plan to create jobs.\n\nMr. Bannon was deeply impressed in 2014 when an insurgent Virginia Republican, David Brat, managed an unexpected primary race upset of Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader. \u201cHe began casting around for other unconventional candidates to support \u2014 people that were not a part of the establishment and would run populist campaigns,\u201d Mr. Schweizer said.\n\nAs Mr. Bannon became a steadily more obvious supporter of Mr. Trump, some Breitbart editors and reporters thought he was turning a news site into a propaganda platform \u2014 though other staff members approved. Mr. Shapiro was the most outspoken critic, saying that Mr. Bannon had \u201cbetrayed\u201d Mr. Breitbart\u2019s mission of \u201cfighting the bullies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrew\u2019s mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Shapiro wrote in a statement when he quit Breitbart in March in support of Michelle Fields, a Breitbart reporter who had been roughly grabbed by Corey Lewandowski, then Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cHe has shaped the company into Trump\u2019s personal Pravda.\u201d\n\nIf the criticism bothered Mr. Bannon, he did not show it. He was already deeply involved in advising Mr. Trump, and he believed, unlike most pollsters and pundits, that the chaotic, low-budget campaign had a chance.\n\nOne warm evening in August, after Mr. Trump called on Mr. Bannon to take charge of the campaign, Mr. Caddell, the pollster, met with him at a New York hotel, sitting outside on a veranda.\n\nMr. Bannon said he knew the campaign needed discipline, with Mr. Trump more consistently presenting himself as a populist outsider, Mr. Caddell recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Believe me, I\u2019m going to bring this home. I know what needs to be done, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Caddell said.\n\nA list of possibilities for key posts in the new administration.\n\nWhatever Reagan scholars like Mr. Cannon might say, Mr. Bossie, who also joined the Trump campaign, said that he and Mr. Bannon discussed Reagan parallels as they saw huge crowds waiting for hours to hear Mr. Trump. Mr. Reagan had run when many voters felt the country was threatened at home and abroad, Mr. Bossie said. \u201cYou can see the same things today with Donald Trump \u2014 that America has lost its way and it\u2019s lost its strength, and Americans are looking for leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nKellyanne Conway, who took the job of campaign manager when Mr. Bannon became chief executive, would later call him \u201cthe general\u201d who made many critical decisions. He pushed for Mr. Trump to visit Flint, Mich., where the water supply was contaminated with lead, and to appear at a black church. Mr. Bannon also hugely accelerated the tempo of what he thought had been a 9-to-5 campaign.\n\nAfter a devastating recording surfaced of Mr. Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, it was Mr. Bannon\u2019s idea to \u201crace to the bottom\u201d by inviting women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual abuse to attend a presidential debate, according to another campaign official. Mr. Bannon believed airing the competing accusations would allow the campaign to return more quickly to the core issues of American nationalism and a suffering middle class, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions.\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. Bannon was sure the polls pointing to a Clinton victory were wrong, other campaign officials said. His family, including all four siblings and his 95-year-old father, made the trip to New York City for election night.\n\nFor Mr. Bannon, the long night at the New York Hilton was his second presidential campaign victory gathering, coming 36 years after the first. At 4:30 a.m., Mr. Vorse, his former colleague, reached him to offer congratulations. He was reminded of their Hollywood days, when \u201cwe would have victories and Steve would celebrate for two seconds, and then it was on to the next thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I got to go because we have a meeting in three hours.

For only the third time in 2016, a major, nonpartisan pollster found Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton in the polls. That finding was reinforced a few days later, when The Washington Post and ABC News released another survey, with Trump up 2. Fox had Trump at 45 percent to Clinton's 42; we had Trump up 46-44.\n\nIn Fox's new poll, out Wednesday evening, Clinton had moved up to 44 percent. But Trump had plunged 7 points -- meaning that Clinton now leads the presumptive Republican nominee by 6 points.\n\nAs we noted on Wednesday, we should be wary of reading too much into national polls at this point -- or, really, ever -- but there's one bit of data in the Fox poll that seems particularly important. When Democrats were asked whether they preferred Clinton as their party's nominee or Bernie Sanders, Clinton was preferred by 21 points. When Republicans were asked if they wanted Trump or \"someone else\" -- a majority picked someone else.\n\nThat split includes a wide majority of women and of those with a college degree. Remember: This is only among Republicans.\n\nWeakening support from Republicans is almost certainly why Trump has dipped in the polls over the past month. In the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, Trump has been under 40 percent against Clinton for the past three weeks. If you include Libertarian Gary Johnson in the mix, Trump hasn't been above 40 percent in the average since RCP started calculating the average in the middle of May.\n\nThere's only one poll in which Trump has topped 40 percent in a three-way contest against Clinton and Johnson: That May Fox survey.\n\nUsing poll data from Huffington Post Pollster, we can show how each major party candidate does with his or her own party. Clinton consistently does better with Democrats than Trump does with Republicans.\n\nShe also does better with Republicans than Trump does with Democrats.\n\nYou may have noticed in the Real Clear Politics graph above a downward dip for Clinton in recent days. That's thanks to the Quinnipiac and Fox polls, outlined with a box below. (As well as a survey from Republican-leaning Rasmussen Reports.)\n\nThe new Fox survey shows a lower level of support for Clinton from Democrats than other recent polls, which combined with increased support from independents for Trump is part of that dip. It's something worth watching over the long term.\n\nThe story at the moment, though, is that Republican voters are not terribly enthusiastic about their candidate, with the party's convention looming. We can demonstrate this another way.\n\nSeventy-one percent of Republicans say Trump is \"obnoxious.\" Thirty-seven percent say he's not sensible. Forty-four percent say Trump's not experienced. Only on honesty are Clinton's numbers worse with her own party than Trump's.\n\nTrump can win without convincing a majority of voters to back him.

Memphis is known for its dry and wet ribs. Texas has its brisket and Kansas City its conflagration-level red sauce. And Chicago? Well, when it comes to barbecue, the Second City has a serious identity crisis.\n\nWhen asked if Chicago has a certain style of barbecue, food writer Calvin Trillin (a Kansas City native) just shrugs. ''Ugh,'' says New York City chef Tom Valenti. Indeed, ''the city is not a barbecue mecca,'' says seven-time world barbecue champion Paul Kirk. If anything, Chicago is known for something far worse: bad barbecue--lukewarm ribs with Jell-O-like meat that slouches like an old man.\n\nWhich is odd. Chicago was a destination after the Civil War and through the 1960s of the African-American migrations from the South, where barbecue has its roots. Music, another southern African-American staple, hitched a ride and eventually evolved into its own form (Chicago blues). Barbecue got lost somewhere along the way.\n\nBut Gary Wiviott--Chicagoan, coauthor of the book Low & Slow: Master the Art of Barbecue in 5 Easy Lessons and self-described ''barbecue life coach''--says critics have it all wrong. Chicago has a distinct style of barbecue, he argues. And--surprise!--it's good.\n\nWiviott, 57, has studied barbecue since the mid-1990s. By day he leases manufacturing equipment. On most nights and weekends he is either cooking, eating or thinking about barbecue. He is goateed and, as one of his friends describes him, ''abdominous.'' You wouldn't want your barbecue life coach any other way.\n\nOn a recent sultry afternoon in Chicago Wiviott made his case for his hometown. The meat--hot links (spicy homemade sausages), ribs and rib tips, which are the fattier ends of the rib carriage--must be cooked over straight wood in what's known as an aquarium-style smoker. These custom-made cookers--rectangular metal containers that are 6 to 8 feet long and attached to a draft vent and fronted with tempered-glass sliding doors--can run upwards of $10,000. They replicate the southern barbecue outdoor cooking tradition without the need for open space.\n\nAquarium smokers are unique to the Chicago area, says Wiviott. They require constant attention--refilling of the wood and tending to the fire. But most Chicago barbecue restaurants, in the interest of mass-producing meat, have turned instead to Southern Pride cookers, which are gas-fired and require far less attention. They generally produce a gummy meat. ''Southern Prides are paint by numbers,'' he says. ''The men who use aquariums are artists working with a blank canvas.'' There is more going on in the cooker than heat transfer. Smoke is a big part of it.\n\nWiviott says the authentic Chicago-style of barbecue has been around since the 1950s, but ''it's a dying art.'' Thankfully there are two places in the city that proudly carry on the tradition.\n\nIn the South Side's gritty Park Manor neighborhood, Mack Sevier, a 65-year-old Arkansan, runs Uncle John's BBQ, opened in 2006. The takeout-only joint is on East 69th Street, in a redbrick building with smoke pouring from its roof. In his hot and noisy kitchen, behind a shield of bulletproof Plexiglas, Sevier chops rib tips into chunks with his lumberjack-size hands. Stacks of sliced white bread--given to his customers to soak up the juices--line the shelves.\n\nSevier constantly monitors his 4-by-6-foot aquarium smoker, in which he uses split elm and mulberry logs. He hands Wiviott a paper boat filled with ribs ($16), rib tips ($9) and hot links ($9) made with a secret spice mixture. The wood gives the tips a toasty taste and the ribs a caramel flavor. The spicy hot links clear your sinuses.\n\nIn Bucktown, on the North Side, Robert Adams, also an Arkansas native, has been running a joint named Honey 1 since 2003. The 60-year-old former truck driver has six pork shoulders on the grill of his 4-by-8-foot aquarium smoker, above the live flame from hickory and white oak. ''These will take 14 hours to cook,'' says Adams as he wipes his brow with a white towel draped over his shoulder. ''It's labor, but if you're gonna cook, do it the right way,'' he says.\n\nAdams serves Wiviott a plate that overflows with ribs ($20 for a full slab), tips ($11.50) and hot links (four for $10.75). Wiviott pronounces the smoky and tender ribs ''toothsome.'' Adams says he'll pass the thriving restaurant on to his 29-year-old son, Robert Jr., someday. ''And I'll reach out from the grave and snatch him if he ever changes anything,'' says Adams.\n\nOn his drive home, with a bellyful of barbecue, Wiviott talks about why people take barbecue so seriously. The heart of the matter, he thinks, is that barbecue is about home. He's happy to have something worth fighting over.\n\nSpecial Offer: Free Trial Issue of Forbes", "summary": "The Windy City isn't known for having quality barbecue.

It was the first member-versus-member primary fight sparked by the redistricting process. Kaptur, who was first elected in 1982, and Kucinich, who was elected in 1996, were thrown into the same northern Ohio district by the redistricting process that follows each Census.

And technically, Kuranaga absolutely sparkles in brilliant turns and light, lyrical balances, with dainty skitters that look as if she is floating on a cushion of air. She gives Ashton\u2019s trademark port de bras a lush fluidity.\n\nHowever, the ballet\u2019s opening belongs mostly to the two stepsisters, hilariously danced \u201cen travestie\u201d by Boyko Dossev and Yuri Yanowsky. (Ashton himself danced as one of the stepsisters with The Royal Ballet for over a quarter century, and he gives the roles substantive footwork and leaps.) As the clueless father (Roddy Doble) reads and Cinderella dusts, the two engage in a bit of tom-foolery and high mugging, tussling over a shawl and preparing for the ball.\n\nIn Ashton\u2019s version, Cinderella\u2019s Fairy Godmother (a gracious Petra Conti) introduces four fairies to prepare Cinderella for the ball. It\u2019s a deviation that slows the story down considerably, but it also affords some terrific solo opportunities.\n\nDusty Button\u2019s The Fairy Winter was a standout, regal and cool, her sharply canted limbs suggesting shards of ice. Twelve Stars, who later recall the midnight hour as the clock ticks down, usher in a gorgeously lit carriage to carry Cinderella off to the ball.\n\nWith flamboyant jumps, split leaps, and tumbles, Avetik Karapetyan\u2019s Jester opens the Act II ball with a bang. Jeffrey Cirio makes a dazzling Prince, with impeccable footwork and lofty grand jet\u00e9s and sissonnes. He provides an attentive partner to Kuranaga\u2019s Cinderella, who contributes the act\u2019s pivotal moment \u2014 a grand entrance en pointe down the central staircase, trailed by yards of tulle.\n\nAnd of course, we get more of the stepsisters. Funny though they are, and performed with great comic zest, they threaten to become too much of a good thing, especially given the ballet\u2019s 2\u00bd-hour plus length. A little tightening would make the work nearly ideal for younger audiences.\n\nThroughout, however, Ashton\u2019s \u201cCinderella\u201d provides an excellent showcase for the company, including a substantial cadre of students. Though some of the corps work looked a little unsettled on opening night, most of the solos, and there were a lot of them, were impressive, and the Boston Ballet Orchestra under conductor Jonathan McPhee imbued Prokofiev\u2019s colorful score with precision and flair.\n\nThe most memorable moment of the ballet is the work\u2019s final tableaux.

They are flooding Twitter with several tweets a minute, signing online petitions and, starting today, planning to rally around the country.\n\nDavis, 42, was convicted of the 1989 shooting death of Savannah, Ga., police officer Mark MacPhail. His supporters say he is innocent, noting that 10 witnesses in the case have signed affidavits recanting their testimony and indicating that police coerced them into implicating Davis. They also point out that nine people have signed affidavits implicating another man.\n\nThe case has attracted attention for years. Former president Jimmy Carter, Pope Benedict XVI and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu are among the prominent figures who have urged that Davis' life be spared.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Davis a hearing to prove his innocence, the first time it had done so for a death row inmate in at least 50 years.\n\nDuring that June 2010 hearing, two witnesses said they falsely incriminated Davis, and two others said another man had confessed to being MacPhail's killer in the years since Davis' trial. U.S. District Judge William Moore said the testimony cast some doubt on Davis' conviction, but was not enough to grant a new trial.\n\nThe latest effort, triggered when a new execution date was set last week, includes celebrities John Legend, Mia Farrow, Bianca Jagger and the Indigo Girls. All are tweeting under #TooMuchDoubt, a hashtag, or search term, devised by Amnesty International and the NAACP. Davis supporters also have created Facebook pages.\n\n\"In the moment, when our nation stumbles toward complete failure of its justice system, we have to give every citizen the opportunity to express their outrage and their intention that the state not do this in their name,\" NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous says. \"When the state executes an innocent person, every citizen is implicated in that act.\"\n\nThe tweets ask the public to contact the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles \u2014 the group with the authority to halt Davis' death \u2014 and to urge the panel to grant clemency. They also ask people to sign one of three petitions the groups are circulating online.\n\n\"I think the key thing we are trying to express to the Georgia authorities is there are just so many doubts,\" says Laura Moye, death penalty abolition campaign director for Amnesty International USA.\n\nThe board is scheduled to meet Monday to consider the case. If it does not grant clemency, there is no official next legal step, but \"we are not going to stand by quietly if that is what happens,\" Moye says. The NAACP also is calling on Chatham County, Ga., District Attorney Larry Chisolm to move to withdraw the death warrant, Jealous says.\n\nRepresentatives from Amnesty International and the NAACP presented four petitions with more than 660,000 signatures to the state parole board Thursday. An online petition sponsored by Davis' sister, Kimberly Davis, and Change.org has collected more than 233,000 signatures.\n\nThe NAACP has declared today a Global Day of Action around the country. Events include a rally at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the church of Martin Luther King. Amnesty International is sponsoring a Global Day of Solidarity in support of Davis.\n\nAs the execution date nears, Kimberly Davis says the family has a strong faith and that her brother has not been talking about the execution.\n\nKimberly Davis says her brother has a strong center. When she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age 14, paralyzed and not expected to live, he left high school and signed up for night courses so he could take her to physical therapy and prod her out of her wheelchair.\n\n\"When I think of my brother, that's my hero,\" says Kimberly Davis, who lives in Savannah. \"We're standing on our faith.\"\n\nMembers of Congress are also involved in the campaign. Fifty-one lawmakers organized by Reps. John Lewis and Hank Johnson, both Georgia Democrats, signed a letter to the parole board asking for Davis' clemency.\n\n\"The 51 members who signed the letter are all deeply concerned about the possibility that the state of Georgia could execute an innocent man,\" Lewis says.\n\nThe decision to employ social media in the campaign was an easy one , says Edward DuBose, president of the Georgia State Conference NAACP.\n\n\"Most people communicate now through social media and we needed to make sure we reach every segment of the population, both young and old,\" DuBose says.\n\nSome of MacPhail's family members blame the advocacy groups for drumming up the worldwide interest.\n\n\"I just think they should stay away. They don't know the case, they're just running their mouths,\" says Anneliese MacPhail, the slain officer's mother. \"It's none of their business.

By contrast, \u0093Did You Used to Be R. D. Laing?\u0094 is a solo show whose subject \u0097 the controversial Scottish psychiatrist Ronald David Laing \u0097 has largely faded from public view, starring an actor who doesn\u0092t impersonate him.\n\nLaing was an international celebrity in the late 1960s. His books questioning orthodox psychiatric practices sold in the millions, and the experimental \u0093safe house\u0094 clinics he founded and inspired (in which patients could \u0093journey\u0094 through their mental illnesses undisturbed by intrusive treatments) were lightning rods for effusive acclaim and scorn. Laing eventually became a guru to innumerable self-indulgent and self-congratulatory followers who distorted his ideas by calling the mad insane and the insane mad, and he did little to repair his image with his frequent drinking binges and flagrant thirst for publicity.\n\nMike Maran, the Scottish actor who wrote, directed and stars in this 90-minute show, explores Laing\u0092s life and work from the perspective of an unnamed genial admirer who says he has just come from Laing\u0092s funeral in 1989. A balding, portly actor sporting a bright red jacket and a wispy beard, Mr. Maran pours himself generous glasses of whiskey while telling stories about \u0093Ronnie\u0094 dating to his lonely childhood and skeptical years in medical school.\n\nWho this character is to Laing is never quite clear, but since his main purpose is conveying information, the vague identity doesn\u0092t matter much. The show is set to a lovely, recorded piano score by David Milligan, and its tone is modest, tranquil and affectionate, carefully avoiding positive or negative exaggeration.\n\nThe disadvantage of such an empathetic and fair-minded approach is that it leaves the audience clueless about why Laing was an object of passionate disagreement. The tales of alcoholic antics and broken marriages notwithstanding, the play\u0092s very pleasantness keeps its prickly subject in an ill-fitting soft focus. We hear tantalizing suggestions of mental illness in Laing\u0092s mother, for instance, but few details, general references to his professional enemies but no accusations of impropriety specific enough for us to judge them.\n\nA sweet nostalgic tribute, \u0093Did You Used to Be R. D. Laing?\u0094 will nevertheless leave many people who are unfamiliar with Laing feeling that they still don\u0092t really know him.\n\n\u0093Did You Used to Be R. D.

Wahlburgers, the restaurant company he owns with his celebrity brothers Mark and Donnie, will on Thursday unveil plans to open 27 more locations.\n\nThe major expansion comes just three years after the first Wahlburgers restaurant opened in Hingham and follows deals for three in Las Vegas and five in the Philadelphia area. A Toronto restaurant \u2014 the second Wahlburgers \u2014 drew huge crowds to a grand opening last month.\n\nThe new franchise agreements include 20 locations in Florida and seven in New York City. But Massachusetts isn\u2019t being left out of the growth spurt \u2014 the Wahlbergs are getting ready to open their second and third Boston-area Wahlburgers restaurants, in Lynnfield and the Fenway. Eventually, the brothers say, there could be up to 300 across the country.\n\nUnlike other restaurant chains, this one\u2019s growing pains are playing out in front of a TV camera. A&E\u2019s reality show, \u201cWahlburgers,\u201d has featured the business in 18 episodes so far. The show brings people to the burger joints. But it also elevates the stage on which Paul Wahlberg works, putting more pressure on him to send customers away satisfied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just fortunate that people are interested in it,\u201d Paul, 50, says of the franchising efforts. \u201cThe family name has some celebrity status to it. But we still have to live up to that.\u201d\n\nThree years after the first location opened in Hingham, the restaurant company is set to unveil plans to open 27 more locations.\n\nThe route to becoming a national chain can be traced to a meeting Mark Wahlberg had with Rick Vanzura, a former cochief operating officer at Panera Bread, soon after the Hingham shop opened. Vanzura was brought on board in 2012, first as a consultant and then as the company\u2019s chief executive, with the charge to chart an expansion plan. Vanzura works at an office across the street from the redeveloped Hingham Shipyard \u2014 the home of the first Wahlburgers and Alma Nove, a restaurant the brothers opened in 2010. Aside from Vanzura and Paul Wahlberg, the corporate staff now consists of just one other person. Vanzura anticipates a few more hires in 2015 and a more meaningful increase in 2016 as restaurants open.\n\nThe A&E show generated interest among potential franchisees. But most of the inquiries don\u2019t make it far: Vanzura says he only considers operators with considerable restaurant experience and a net worth of at least $5 million.\n\nThe Toronto operators \u2014 including hotelier Henry Wu and investor Michael Wekerle \u2014 had a relationship with the Wahlbergs as investors in Hingham. Wu says he\u2019s also investing in the Fenway and Lynnfield locations. He says he was attracted to the concept\u2019s unusual mix of sit-down service on one side of the room, with alcohol, and fast-casual service on the other. His team plans to open several more in Canada, likely starting in Ontario. Wu says the 120-seat restaurant in downtown Toronto already has exceeded expectations: The tables turn at least three times every dinner period and up to six times on busy nights.\n\nIn Florida, franchisee Manny Garcia was introduced to the Wahlbergs through Orlando venture capital firm Blackwood Holdings. Garcia, a former Burger King franchisee who sold his 67 BK shops in the 1990s, established Davgar Holdings to oversee his family\u2019s three restaurants in the Orlando area.\n\nDavgar\u2019s restaurants will include the Wahlburgers locations in Florida.\n\nGarcia says that by the time he got involved, he had already seen the TV series. He saw a kindred spirit in Paul \u2014 someone with a passion for the restaurant business. The first Florida Wahlburgers will likely be on his home turf in the Orlando area, and he says he will scout for locations in Miami and Tampa, with Blackwood providing a major equity investment.\n\nWahlburgers faces plenty of competition as the chain grows. The \u201cbetter burger\u201d segment of the casual dining market is already crowded, with the likes of Five Guys, Smashburger, and Shake Shack, says Darren Tristano, of the restaurant consultancy Technomic in Chicago. Many rivals offer burgers for less than the $7 or more that Wahlburgers charges, although most don\u2019t have sit-down service or alcohol. \u201cSo many players have gotten into the space,\u201d Tristano says. \u201cIt\u2019s hitting a saturation point.\u201d\n\nLike many restaurants, the Wahlburgers shops don\u2019t always open on their original timetables. The brothers hoped they could open the location on Brookline Avenue in the Fenway \u2014 which, like the Hingham spot, will be in a Samuels & Associates development \u2014 in time for opening day at Fenway Park next year. Now, they\u2019re aiming for the summer.\n\nPaul admits to some nervousness as he works under the unyielding heat of a national spotlight. But he\u2019s hardly planning on getting out of the kitchen. \u201cThere are going to be hiccups,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are going to be bumps in the road. But we have to keep plugging along and doing the best that we can.\u201d\n\nDebee Tlumacki for the Globe/File 2011\n\nWahlburgers is looking to expand its restaurants brand beyond its first shop in Hingham.", "summary": "Three years after the first Wahlburgers shop opened in Hingham, a plan to build a national chain is starting to come to fruition.

Look the world straight in the eye,\u201d one of them goes. \u201cKeep your face in the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow,\u201d instructs another. Or, \u201cOptimism is the faith that leads to achievement.\u201d\n\nPerhaps less catchy and sentimental, and certainly less well known, are the numerous observations on inequality, poverty and class that Keller made during her lifetime as a socialist activist. \u201cYours for the revolution!\u201d she declared, in a 1919 letter to Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) founder Eugene Debs. \u201cMay it come swiftly,\u201d she continued, \u201clike a shaft sundering the dark!\u201d\n\nThe popular narrative of Helen Keller\u2014born 135 years ago this weekend, on June 27, 1880\u2014is a classic American story about triumphing in the face of adversity, which emphasizes individual determination over political action. But Keller\u2019s true legacy also includes a commitment to socioeconomic justice, which she saw as instrumental to improving the lives of people with disabilities.\n\nIn 1933, TIME described Keller as a \u201cblind-deaf mute who has become a highly educated and intelligent young woman.\u201d Born in Tuscumbia, Ala., Keller became ill with a fever at 19 months old, resulting in vision and hearing loss. She was a \u201cspoiled, sturdy little animal,\u201d wrote TIME, \u201chopelessly limited, and given to wild tantrums when cross.\u201d This changed after Keller\u2019s parents hired Anne Sullivan, a gifted young teacher, to show their daughter how to communicate. Thanks to Sullivan\u2019s care and her student\u2019s own persistence, Keller thrived, going on to graduate from Radcliffe College at age 24. Sullivan \u201cfirst disciplined [Keller] into docility, then won her affection,\u201d as TIME put it, a process dramatized in the Oscar-nominated 1962 film The Miracle Worker.\n\nBecause of the film\u2019s focus, many people know more about Keller\u2019s early years than they do about the remainder of her life. She is most often remembered for proving that people with disabilities can achieve success and live independently. But to frame her life as an up-by-the-bootstraps tale, in which sheer optimism and perseverance solve the personal challenge of disability, is to miss a large portion of what Keller fought for.\n\nAfter college, Keller read Braille translations of works by Karl Marx, H.G. Wells and William Morris. She joined the Socialist party in 1909, and became an IWW member shortly thereafter, supporting strikes, walking picket lines, giving lecture tours and writing articles for publications like The Liberator. She noticed the close relationship between disability and poverty, and blamed capitalism and poor industrial conditions for both. As Keller told the New York Tribune in 1916, blindness was \u201coften caused by the selfishness and greed of employers.\u201d\n\nIn her writings and speeches, Keller called for revolution rather than reform. She had no patience for compromise, and argued that charitable aid did more to assuage the guilt of the prosperous than to improve the conditions of vulnerable people\u2019s lives. Instead, Keller called for the dismantling of an economic order in which \u201cthe working class lives in want while the master class lives in luxury.\u201d\n\nLike many radicals of the 1910s and 1920s, Keller was concerned with multiple social-justice causes\u2013she was a pacifist, a suffragist, a birth-control advocate, a supporter of the NAACP and a co-founder of the ACLU. But it was Keller\u2019s socialist values that informed her position on other issues; she opposed World War I, for instance, on the grounds that it served capitalist interests, and helped create the ACLU as a way to protect striking workers from jail and deportation.\n\nDespite these activities, Keller is more commonly remembered for the fundraising and advocacy work she did on behalf of the American Federation for the Blind, a largely apolitical organization. In fact, Keller\u2019s leftist sympathies occasionally ruffled feathers with the conservative members of the American Federation. Her radical views also made her a target of FBI surveillance for most of her life. Still, Keller continued to support socialist and communist leaders, even in the midst of Cold War McCarthyism.\n\nKeller has been given the Martin Luther King Jr. treatment: the more difficult and controversial aspects of her life have been neutralized in educational curricula, as well as in the public imagination. But during a time in which one in four disabled adults live in poverty in the United States, her perspectives on economic injustice remain significant. Inspirational messages on refrigerator magnets and postcards can temporarily lift someone\u2019s mood, but throughout her life Keller wanted more than that. Rather than asking for hope, she demanded equality.", "summary": "Learning to communicate was only the first step for the iconic advocate", "density": 1.0, "coverage": 0.6666666667000001, "compression": 77.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/14/vw-porsche-stake-markets-equities-autos-takeover.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2009081519id_/http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/14/vw-porsche-stake-markets-equities-autos-takeover.html", "title": "VW And Porsche United", "date": "2009081519", "text": "LONDON -- Europe's biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, is finally taking over Porsche after agreeing on Thursday to buy a 42% stake in the sports car unit of debt-ridden Porsche, ending months of fractious relations between the two companies.\n\nVolkswagen expects the deal to be completed by 2011 and provide a total of 700 million euros ($999 million) in savings from synergies. The carmaker will launch a capital increase in its preference shares in the first half of 2010to protect its credit after the merger and to fund the acquisition, it added.\n\nAnalysts said VW is getting a good deal. Nomura said VW is acquiring \"a strong asset\" for a \"good price\".\n\nLast month, Porsche Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking agreed to step down after the Piech and Porsche families ended a longtime struggle over the future of the debt-laden German sports car maker they are part owners of. The logic was that new management would be better placed to smooth the path to a merger. (See \"Porsche Chief Gets the Boot.\")\n\nInitially, Porsche's plan had been for the takeover to work the other way around. But in its efforts to raise its 51% stake in Volkswagen to 75%, Porsche built up huge debts as its plans coincided with the global credit crisis and falling demand for cars. Porsche also said on Thursday that its board had appointed Martin Winterkorn as chief executive of the new company with effect from Sept. 15. Winterkorn said the deal marked \"a new era\" for both companies. \"Porsche is a real enrichment for our company's portfolio,\" he said.\n\nVW's Chief Financial Officer Hans Dieter Poetsch said the Porsche controlling families expect to take a share of between 35% to 39% in the new firm, while the Qatar Investment Authority \"would become the third biggest shareholder\" at Volkswagen with a \"substantial stake\". Qatar made an offer to invest in Porsche and to purchase options in Volkswagen last June. The German State of Lower Saxony, which owns a 20.1% minority stake in Volkswagen, will retain its blocking vote. A new name for the company is yet to be decided.\n\nThe integrated company will have 10 brands, adding the Porsche brand to a portfolio that already includes Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Skoda, Seat and Lamborghini. VW has pledged it will give Porsche \"independence\" and it said it would preserve its \"solid financial base.\"\n\nNomura analysts, however, said that Volkswagen investors might be put off by the capital increase announced by the company for the first half of next year. Others share their concern: \"The plan could curb the share price development of VW preference shares,' said analysts at LBBW in a note to clients.

The agency reported 502 employee accidents last year, and 924 in 2000.\n\nThere may have been more injuries than accidents. The agency counts a single incident that injures multiple employees as only one accident, according to Paul J. Fleuranges, a transit agency spokesman. He said the reduction in serious accidents was a result of an agency policy promoting safety.\n\nUnion officials expressed skepticism over the agency\u2019s data. The agency does not include cases when it has challenged an employee\u2019s injury report to the state\u2019s worker compensation system, a practice the union officials described as frequent.\n\nThe 60-page safety curriculum, provided by the agency to The New York Times, covers key workplace issues, including guidelines for moving and working around the tracks and the third rail and the \u201ctool box safety talks\u201d that every work crew is supposed to have before entering the track area. It also covers rules for using warning lanterns that alert train operators that workers are present, and it reviews the procedure for workers to challenge orders from supervisors when they believe they are unsafe.\n\nAn official briefed on the safety curriculum said that the \u201cNo Short Cuts\u201d conclusion was intended as a general warning to follow safety rules closely. It can also be interpreted, the official said, as a specific reference to what investigators believe happened Sunday afternoon, when the two workers involved in that accident apparently took a shortcut across live tracks rather than taking a longer and safer route that would have required going up and down two sets of stairs in the station.\n\nThe investigation into that accident will focus in part on what instructions the men received from their supervisor and whether they were told to cross the live tracks, the official said.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s accident, Mr. Franklin, and another worker, Jeff Hill, 41, were part of a crew doing routine maintenance on the Queens-bound A and C line tracks at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station. Trains had been shut down on the A and C lines at that station for the weekend, but there was still regular service on the G line, which also runs through the station.\n\nInvestigators believe that the men were told by a supervisor to retrieve a dolly, or hand truck, from the vicinity of the Manhattan-bound A and C tracks, on the other side of the station. When they men returned with the dolly, they apparently carried it across the two sets of G tracks, which run through the center of the station, according to an official briefed on the investigation.\n\nA senior official at the transit agency said that no warning lamps had been set out and that no worker with a flag had been positioned on the G tracks to alert oncoming trains to slow down or stop.\n\nTheir trip across the tracks broke at least two work rules, according to one of the officials familiar with the investigation. A flagger with warning lamps must be posted on the live tracks before work can be done there or equipment can be carried across, the official said. And workers must also cover the third rail with thick rubber mats before carrying equipment across it, the official said. It appears that neither of those procedures were followed.\n\nThe safety curriculum goes into great detail on posting flaggers and warning lamps on the tracks and includes a memo from last June titled \u201cCarrying Tools and Equipment Over Live Third Rails.\u201d\n\nThe safety curriculum also gives something of the flavor of the dangers that workers face, frequently warning employees to look in both directions for trains. In some cases, it says, work trains or other trains can actually run the wrong way on tracks. Employees, it says, \u201cmust expect trains to operate in either direction and be prepared to take safe positions at all times.\u201d", "summary": "New York City Transit has designed an urgent refresher course in safety for workers after two fatal accidents.", "density": 1.5789473684000002, "coverage": 0.7368421053, "compression": 41.6315789474, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "http://www.9news.com.au/afp/2015/03/29/08/43/suspect-package-prompts-madrid-post-office-evacuation", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015032919id_/http://www.9news.com.au/afp/2015/03/29/08/43/suspect-package-prompts-madrid-post-office-evacuation", "title": "Suspicious package prompts Madrid post office evacuation", "date": "2015032919", "text": "Spanish emergency service members, policemen and firefighters, are deployed outside Cibeles Palace, Madrid's City Hall, after a suspicius envelope was found in the post office annexed to the City Hall.

The trade winds that once carried tall ships from around the world to Antigua today carry to my room the smell of tropical flowers.\n\nAndrew Michelin, whose family came from Europe to the Caribbean several generations ago, says he planned every detail of his small resort so that visitors would have a true Caribbean experience. The roof of each cottage, for example, is made of galvanized metal, so if there happens to be a shower during your stay, you'll hear the sound of raindrops popping off a tin roof.\n\n\"When you first wake up, I don't want you to think even for a second, 'Where am I?' \" Michelin says. \"I want you to awaken and feel where you are, smell where you are, hear where you are.\"\n\nThat sense of place, of foreignness, of being far from home, goes a long way toward explaining the appeal of a small resort. Then, too, there is the intimacy that comes with being one of a handful of guests, rather than one of an anonymous crowd of hundreds moving through a high-rise mega-resort.\n\nThe Cocos resort, where I spend my first two nights in Antigua, has just 19 cottages. There are no lines of people waiting to register when I arrive around lunchtime. In fact, I'm the only guest in sight, and the receptionist offers me something to drink before asking my name.\n\nThis is my Caribbean dream. When I open the door of my room, I want to see not a long hallway and a blank elevator door, but blue water and green hills. I like my flowers alive and growing, not arranged in a giant vase in the lobby. I come to escape lines, not to join them. Sure, I understand the appeal of on-site fitness centers, kids' clubs, water sports, organized games, poolside fashion shows and the huge \"native\" buffets common in mega-resorts, but I'll exchange all that for the feeling of escape from the modern world.\n\nApparently, I am not the only person drawn to intimate properties, even though -- or perhaps because -- they are more unpredictable than large brand-name resorts. In fact, the rising popularity of small hotels is the biggest trend in the Caribbean, says Richard Kahn, a consultant to the Caribbean Tourism Organization, a trade group that represents the islands.\n\nIt's really a return to the Caribbean of old.\n\n\"Until the late 1980s, 80 percent of the hotel infrastructure throughout the Caribbean was small, intimate, family-owned properties. In the 1990s, there was a huge influx of sprawling high-rise properties with brand names,\" Kahn says. \"What's taking place in the last year or so: The boutique hotels are making a comeback. There is a major resurgence of independent operators building and refurbishing properties that are no more than 80 rooms.\"\n\nSmall hotels tend to be as different and as quirky as the individuals who own them. Why, for example, does Cocos's outdoor dining area have three adjoining decks overlooking the water? Because Michelin started with one, and when he got more money, he built the second. Then when his daughter was getting married, he did some cost calculations and figured it would be almost as cheap to add a third deck big enough to host her reception as it would be to book a catering hall.\n\nSmall Caribbean hotels and resorts run from budget to luxury -- from $100 to more than $3,000 a night. Every island in the Caribbean has small hotels and resorts, but Antigua is famous for them. Luxurious high-end resorts with big advertising budgets have played a major role in developing Antigua's reputation. One example: Carlisle Bay, where an all-inclusive night for two runs from $786 off-peak to as much as $3,472 over Christmas. At the all-inclusive Curtain Bluff, often included on lists of the most romantic places in the world, a night for two ranges from $732 to $1,439.\n\nYou know without seeing these properties that they must be pretty nice.

It shows how hard regulators are working to ensure that banks have plans for worst-case scenarios and can act rationally in times of distress.\n\nOfficials like Lehman Brothers former Chief Executive Dick Fuld have been criticized for having been too hesitant to take bold steps to solve their banks' problems during the financial crisis.\n\nFeds won't charge Goldman for infamous trades\n\nAccording to documents obtained by Reuters, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency first directed five banks -- which also include Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co -- to come up with these \"recovery plans\" in May 2010.\n\nThey told banks to consider drastic efforts to prevent failure in times of distress, including selling off businesses, finding other funding sources if regular borrowing markets shut them out, and reducing risk. The plans must be feasible to execute within three to six months, and banks were to \"make no assumption of extraordinary support from the public sector,\" according to the documents.\n\nSpokespeople for the five banks declined to comment. The Federal Reserve also declined to comment.\n\n'Protecting the system'Recovery plans differ from living wills, also known as \"resolution plans,\" which are required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Living wills aim to end bailouts of too-big-to-fail banks by showing how they would liquidate themselves without imperiling the financial system.\n\n\"Recovery plans are about protecting the crown jewels,\" said Paul Cantwell, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal. \"It's about, 'How do I sell off non-core assets?' The priority is to the shareholders. A resolution plan is about protecting the system, taxpayers and creditors.\"\n\nNY regulator may pull license of 'rogue' UK bank over Iran deals\n\nThe recovery plans are being used as part of regulators' ongoing supervisory process.

The names of the banks required to submit them have not been previously disclosed, and Reuters obtained them only through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe Fed supplied Reuters with the letters requesting plans from banks, but not the banks' actual plans because they were deemed confidential supervisory information. The regulator said it was withholding 5,100 pages of information.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, long one of the most vocal critics of regulations aimed at curbing risky trading, announced a $2 billion loss after taking a risky bet that didn't pay off. CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin reports.\n\nReputations, but not balance sheets, damagedFive years after the financial crisis, concerns remain about whether blow-ups at big banks could lead to another round of taxpayer bailouts. Trading losses have cost JPMorgan nearly $6 billion so far, and scandals such as the alleged rigging of an international interest rate benchmark have only highlighted the risks lurking inside big banks.\n\nSources: Arrests are coming in Libor scandal\n\nThese disasters have damaged banks' reputations, but not their balance sheets. Most are still profitable, and in recent years the five banks have improved their capital bases and liquidity. They also have been subjected to annual Federal Reserve stress tests that measure whether the banks have sufficient capital to weather severe economic scenarios.\n\nBank of America and Citigroup, in a sense, have already been executing the kind of moves called for in the recovery plans. Both have been selling off non-core operations and assets to streamline their sprawling businesses, after receiving multiple bailouts during the financial crisis.\n\nJPMorgan losses revive worries that Washington is unable to regulate Wall Street\n\nBank of America in June 2011 told Fed officials that it could shed branches in some parts of the country if it needed to raise capital in an emergency, a person familiar with the matter said in January. The proposal was part of a series of options provided to the Fed, including issuing a tracking stock for Bank of America's Merrill Lynch operations.\n\nBut just because the bank proposed selling branches does not mean it's a desirable move or highly probable, the person said. In the past year, Bank of America has shown progress in building capital without such actions. Its Tier 1 common capital ratio increased to 11.24 percent of risk-weighted assets as of June 30 from 8.23 percent a year earlier.\n\nTier 1 refers to a bank's core capital and has been the main focus of regulators in assessing a bank's capital adequacy.\n\nReport: HSBC allowed money laundering that likely funded terror, drugs\n\nThe banks' chief risk officers, and in the case of Citigroup, Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, received letters in May 2010 instructing them on what to include in the recovery plans. The requests stemmed from January 2010 crisis management meetings held by regulators. The letters sent to the five banks were nearly identical.\n\nJPMorgan's blunder amplifies calls for tighter regulation\n\nEach plan was to address severe financial stress at the firm, as well as \"general financial instability.\" The plans should be capable of being executed ideally within three months, but no longer than six months, the documents said.\n\nThe plans should \"make appropriate assumptions as to the valuations of assets and off-balance sheet positions,\" the documents said.\n\nDavid Gregory, Meet the Press moderator, discusses JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's interview on his show prior to the announcement of the firm's $2 billion trading loss.\n\nRecovery plans have been mentioned in public before, but only in passing. In testimony to Congress in July 2010, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said the \"largest internationally active U.S. banking organizations\" were working on recovery plans. The initiative stemmed from work led by the Financial Stability Board, a body that coordinates the work of international financial regulators, he said.\n\nIn a presentation in March, JPMorgan Chase said it had a recovery plan in place and said it was ordered by regulators.

We started writing about a week ago,\" Snyder said, referring to his script work with \"300\" collaborator Kurt Johnstad. \"So we're doing it. It's happening.\"\n\nSnyder has a first-look deal with Warner Bros. (which is taking his 2011 film \"Sucker Punch\" down to Comic-Con International in a big way this Saturday) and the presumption is that Snyder will direct this film, but that's not a done deal yet.\n\n\"It's really going to depend on what the studio wants to do and what we do when we finish; I don't have a directing deal in place but we are writing it, so call it intent,\" Snyder said with a chuckle when I visited his office the other day. \"If there was a crime they could probably convict me.\"\n\nSome people did consider \"300\" a cultural crime of sorts -- others swooned for the striking, hyper-reality visuals and ferocious tale of death and duty. The 2007 film was the defining career moment to date for the 44-year-old Snyder. The added up to a surprise hit; \"300\" set new box-office records for a March release and became the highest-grossing R-rated film of the year with $456 million in worldwide box office. It also made a star of Gerard Butler and pushed Miller, the writer-artist of the \"300\" graphic novel, into the arena of media opinion when the movie was searched for contemporary geopolitical themes.\n\nBut \"300\" also became an international incident, of sorts. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bitterly denounced the film and the Iranian Academy of the Arts filed a formal complaint through the United Nations that framed the movie as nothing less than an attack on the historical identity of a nation -- especially with its portrayal of Xerxes (portrayed by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro) as leering and androgynous and the Persian army as a demonic horde.\n\n\"300\" first appeared in the pages of Dark Horse Comics, with Miller writing and drawing. That's the starting point too for \"Xerxes,\" which Miller talked about in detail here at the Hero Complex a few weeks ago. The comics will be published in the months ahead, but Miller has already shown Snyder enough to win him over to a follow-up film. It's neither prequel nor sequel, precisely, since the time setting begins years before the events of \"300\" and then moves up past the first film's 480 B.C. Spartan battle.\n\n\"This movie follows Themistocles and the Battle of Artemisium, which coincidentally happens on the exact same three days as the Battle of Thermopylae [which was the basis of '300'],\" Snyder said. \"This one starts off with a quick retelling of the why of the Persian wars. It starts off at the Battle of Marathon and then it goes back to Themistocles finding out that Persians are invading again. and off we go over to learn a little bit about why Xerxes is the way he is.\"\n\nHe went on with a Greek history lesson told in Synder's dude-speak: \"Darius [the Persian king and father of Xerxes] gets wounded at Marathon and he's super cool and like a great guy. Even the Greeks are like, 'Darius is awesome.' After Darius dies, Xerxes is so distraught, but Darius had told him, 'Don't attack the Greeks, only a god can punish the Greeks.' So that's when he calls his mystics and wizards and says, 'Make me a god so I can avenge my father.' \"\n\nI had dropped by to see footage from \"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,\" the filmmaker's first animated feature and a passion project for producer Debbie Synder, his partner in marriage and movie making. (\"Guardians,\" by the way, is visually stunning and could be a September sensation with youngsters; that's the hope of of Warners, certainly, where one publicist has a new slogan: \"Owls are the new penguins.\") So all of this \"Xerxes\" talk was a bit of surprise, but the director of \"Watchmen\" was clearly caught up in the early passion needed for any filmmaker to take on such a massive project.\n\n\"What I said to the studio is that '300' gave everyone a chance to fight alongside a super warrior, a chance to fight alongside these Spartan warriors that you could never fight against; but Themistocles is different, he is us,\" Snyder said. \"It's much more about the everyman.\"\n\nHe added: \"Themistocles is kind of the father of democracy. It's much more about these guys choosing. The Spartans are, 'We fight, we die,' so that's an easy choice for them, there's no surrender. The cool thing about Themistocles and his gang is that it's way more difficult. Things aren't as clear or unchallenged. He has to be more political to get everyone to agree. It's political, in the soap-opera sense of the word. There's a relationship with Leonidas ... and ... well, we'll see where it all goes.\"\n\nLeonidas,of course, was Butler's character in \"300,\" but Snyder said he hasn't called the Scottish actor up yet to talk about the new project and the possibility of a cameo. I asked about the look of the film -- would it have the same liquid mayhem and fiery nightmare visuals as \"300\"?\n\n\"Yes, it's the same universe visually,\" Snyder said, suggesting that in his mind he's already directing the film even though there's only a writing deal in place.\n\nHe seemed most excited about the climatic sea battle that would take \"Xerxes\" the film into a novel cinematic battle zone. \"The triremes all crash together, and as they all ram in you have basic hoplite combat. But it's all on the deck on these crashing ships -- there's even horses riding across them,\" Snyder said. \"How cool is that?\"\n\nGeoff Boucher will moderate the \"Sucker Punch\" panel with Zack Snyder and cast members at Comic-Con International in Hall H on Saturday.\n\nZack Snyder's \"Sucker Punch\" will be a special brand of girl crazy\n\nFrank Miller's Spartan code: \"I make no apologies whatsoever\"\n\nZack Snyder among Hollywood players with video-game ventures\n\nIs \"Watchmen\" the \"Fight Club\" of comic-book films?\n\nAlan Moore on \"Watchmen\" film: \"I will be spitting venom all over it\"\n\nSILLY VIDEO \"Watchmen,\" Saturday morning safe!\n\nFrank Miller talks about his \"terrible, glorious\" F-bombsPHOTOS: Top: Zack Snyder (Credit: Clay Enos).

Mr. Polanski was arrested on his way to the Zurich Film Festival after Swiss authorities received a letter from the Department of Justice requesting that he be held for possible extradition to the United States.\n\nThe department sent the letter at the request of Los Angeles prosecutors, who have pursued Mr. Polanski since 1978. He fled the United States that year ahead of his sentencing after pleading guilty to having sex with a minor, part of a plea agreement that allowed him to avoid other charges, including rape and sodomy.\n\nMr. Weingarten is expected to mount a legal effort to block Mr. Polanski\u2019s extradition before the issue works its way through the Swiss legal system, according to people who were briefed on Mr. Weingarten\u2019s involvement, but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nA critical step will most likely be a move to stop the extradition before United States authorities send the required documents to Switzerland. Mr. Polanski\u2019s team may do so by arguing either that his crime does not qualify for extradition, because he was originally to have been sentenced to less than a year in prison, or that he has already effectively served his sentence, during a 42-day psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMr. Weingarten declined to comment.\n\nA former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity division, Mr. Weingarten is described as one of Mr. Holder\u2019s closest friends, and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation, which helps disadvantaged children.\n\nFor two days, Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves. Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr. Polanski, who, he said \u201cperhaps had committed a youthful error.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday, though, the mood was shifting. Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party, criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too quickly to support Mr. Polanski. On the extreme right, the father and daughter politicians Jean-Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers, saying they were supporting \u201ca criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political-artistic class.\u201d\n\nMarie-Louise Fort, an Assembly member who has sponsored anti-incest legislation, said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr. Polanski.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr. Polanski at all,\u201d Ms. Fort said. \u201cI believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple.\u201d\n\nThe mood was more hostile in blogs and e-mail to newspapers and news magazines. An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30,000 respondents said Mr. Polanski should face justice.\n\nStill, many continued to rally to the director\u2019s defense.\n\nFilm industry leaders like Pedro Almod\u00f3var, Martin Scorsese, Costa-Gavras and Woody Allen signed a petition with more than 100 names that expressed \u201cstupefaction\u201d with the arrest. But support was not universal; Luc Besson, a prominent French film director and producer, was not on the list, though he describes himself as a Polanski friend.\n\n\u201cOur daughters are good friends,\u201d Mr. Besson said in a radio interview with RTL Soir. \u201cBut there is one justice, and that should be the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nMichael Cieply reported from Los Angeles, and Doreen Carvajal from Paris.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on September 30, 2009, on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Powerful Player Joins Polanski Team.

He was 79.\n\nThe cause was emphysema, his daughter, Vanessa Holland, said.\n\nIn winning tournament after tournament and three world championships, Mr. Holland brought a cool self-confidence to the rapid-fire clacking of the checker-like pieces (the \u201cmen\u201d) around the 24 narrow triangles of the backgammon board.\n\n\u201cHe did not speak; he did not smile; his eyes rarely left the table,\u201d Jon Bradshaw wrote of Mr. Holland in his 1975 book, \u201cFast Company\u201d (Harper\u2019s). \u201cThere was a palpable arrogance in his play. He rolled the dice and moved the men about the board with the poise of a man who knows that victory is only a matter of time.\u201d\n\nMr. Holland won the World Backgammon Association championship in 1967, 1968 and 1971. (No championship tournaments were held in 1969 or 1970.) Besides retaining the title, he pocketed more than $30,000 in prize money for each of those championships. By the early 1970s he was averaging $60,000 a year in tournament money, and that did not include significant earnings from bets he had placed on himself or his percentage from the winnings of the highest bidders at tournaments where the best players were \u201cauctioned off.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolland is generally believed to be the best backgammon player in the world,\u201d The New York Times said in a 1974 article describing the renaissance of a game played in the days of the pharaohs. In the five years since 1969, it said, the number of Americans playing backgammon jumped from 200,000 to two million. By then, they were spending more than $6 million a year on backgammon sets, from run-of-the-mill boards selling for $5 to Chinese lacquer designs costing more than $500.\n\nIn that revival, Mr. Holland saw another path to profit \u2014 teaching. He wrote three books: \u201cBeginning Backgammon\u201d (1973); \u201cBetter Backgammon\u201d (1974), for intermediate players; and \u201cBackgammon for People Who Hate to Lose\u201d (1977), about the psychological aspects of the game. All three books were published by the David McKay company. Mr. Holland also invented the Autobackgammon, a contraption that allowed players to play by themselves.\n\nAlexis Obolensky, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 aristocrat, had introduced backgammon to the jet set in the 1960s, organizing tournaments in the Bahamas, Monte Carlo and St. Martin. In 1972 he founded the Backgammon Association of America, establishing a standardized set of rules. It is now called the United States Backgammon Federation.\n\nThe backgammon craze has somewhat faded since. Still, it is believed to be the world\u2019s oldest board game. Archaeologists have discovered a 5,000-year-old board at the site of Ur of the Chaldees in Iraq. In Egypt, a backgammon set was found in King Tut\u2019s tomb. To this day it is a favored game in the Middle East.\n\nIt was not always Mr. Holland\u2019s favorite game.\n\nBorn on March 3, 1931, in Rockville Centre, N.Y., Simeon Holland was the only son of Simeon and Inez Holland. When he was 7, Tim (as he later chose to be called) won a father-son golf tournament and a mother-son tournament at a local country club. He starred on his high school golf team, then decided that Florida was the best place to play that game. After graduating from the University of Miami in 1952, he struggled to make a living playing golf. At a country club in Miami, he noticed several older men playing a board game he had never seen before. They taught him, and he was hooked.\n\nBesides his daughter, Mr. Holland is survived by his wife of 28 years, the former Nancy Zorn; two stepsons, Andrew and Jimmy Zorn; and a granddaughter, Stephanie. Mr. Holland was divorced four or five times, his daughter said.\n\nIn backgammon, a game for two players, each player moves 15 men along the triangles, or \u201cpoints,\u201d of the pattern on the board according to the roll of the dice. The first to remove all 15 wins. Although luck plays a significant role with each roll of the dice, players must still choose from among numerous options for moving pieces and anticipate countermoves by the opponent. And they can raise the gambling stakes during the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the luck factor that seduces everyone into believing that they are good, that they can actually win, but that\u2019s just wishful thinking,\u201d Mr. Holland was quoted in \u201cFast Company\u201d as saying.\n\nIt took several years and losses of about \u201c30,000 bucks\u201d to master the game, he continued.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, it took a little time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I got it all back from the sharks that took it from me.

Research in rodents has shown that liquids secreted from glands near the eye have a variety of social effects. In mole rats, they reduce aggressiveness in head-to-head underground confrontations. In mice, they stimulate aggression between males but promote mating behavior between males and females.\n\n\"What we have found is that human emotional crying may not be so unique after all,\" Sobel said. \"It is a reflection of something common to many if not all mammals, which is chemosignaling through lacrimal secretions.\"\n\nThe study, which entailed collecting tears and exposing people to them in a laboratory, was greeted positively by the small circle of researchers who study crying.", "summary": "It's widely held that a woman's tears will turn a man to mush.

The band entered Orlando's Citrus Bowl stadium prior to kickoff for the school's season-opening football game against Mississippi Valley State. It is giving its return performance at halftime.\n\nAll band performances were halted for FAMU's famed Marching 100 shortly after Robert Champion collapsed and died following a hazing ritual on a bus parked at an Orlando hotel in November 2011. The ritual occurred shortly after the band had returned to its hotel from a performance at the annual Florida Classic football game.\n\nSchool officials lifted the nearly two-year suspension for the band in June as the latest in several sweeping changes FAMU has made in an attempt to end a culture of hazing. The fallout from Champion's death included the departure of the band's longtime director and the abrupt resignation of the university's president, James Ammons.\n\nAt a news conference last month to formally announce of the band's return performance, FAMU's interim president, Larry Robinson, reiterated that the school has taken several measures to prevent hazing, including a new student code of conduct, new procedures to report and investigate hazing, an anti-hazing website, assigning faculty to research hazing and more.\n\n\"This band will be a model of excellence for other bands across this nation. It will actually focus on its founding principles of character, academics, leadership, marching and service,\" Robinson said of the band's return. \"When you look at all these actions that we've taken in total, we are fairly confident that we are about to launch a new era and a new understanding and appreciation as to why hazing is not necessary to advance these principles.\"\n\nFifteen former band members were charged with manslaughter and felony hazing in Champion's death.

This state \u2014 and this native of it \u2014 have long indulged a borderline-comic impulse toward self-expression through lifestyle and food, as if success might be a matter of nailing the perfect combination of surf trunks, grilled lamb hearts and sunset views.\n\nFor baby boomers who moved to the Bay Area in search of the unfussy good life, in the late 20th century, it was all about squinting just right to make our dry coastal hills look like Provence \u2014 per the instructions of the Francophile chefs Jeremiah Tower and Alice Waters of the legendary Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse.\n\nBy the early 2000s, that Eurocentric baby-boomer cuisine enjoyed a prosperous middle age as \u201cmarket-driven Cal/French/Italian\u201d with an implicit lifestyle fantasy involving an Italianate Sonoma home with goats, a cheese-making barn, vineyards and olive trees, and a code of organic-grass-fed ethics that mapped a reliable boundary between food fit for bourgeois progressives and unclean commodity meats.\n\nToday, Northern California has been taken over by a tech-boom generation with vastly more money and a taste for the existential pleasures of problem solving. The first hints of change appeared in 2005, when local restaurateurs sensed that it was time for a new culinary style with a new lifestyle fantasy. That\u2019s when a leading San Francisco chef named Daniel Patterson published an essay that blamed the \u201ctyranny of Chez Panisse\u201d for stifling Bay Area culinary innovation. Next came the 2009 Fig-Gate scandal in which the chef David Chang, at a panel discussion in New York, said, \u201cEvery restaurant in San Francisco is serving figs on a plate with nothing on it.\u201d Northern California erupted with an indignation that Mr. Chang called, in a subsequent interview, \u201cjust retardedly stupid.\u201d Mr. Chang added that, as he put it, \u201cPeople need to smoke more marijuana in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nBy this point, I was a food writer of the not-anonymous variety, by which I mean that I joined the search for the next big thing by eating great meals courtesy of magazines and restaurants, without hiding my identity the way a critic would. In 2010, a magazine asked me to profile the extraordinary chef David Kinch of the aforementioned fancy restaurant, which is called Manresa and lies in the affluent suburb of Los Gatos.\n\nI went there twice for work and concentrated both times on the food alone. I was knocked out, especially by a creation called Tidal Pool, which involved a clear littoral broth of seaweed dashi pooling around sea-urchin tongues, pickled kelp and foie gras. I know that I will set off the gag reflex in certain quarters when I confess that, in my view, Mr. Kinch took the sensory pleasure of falling off a surfboard into cold Northern California water and transformed it into the world\u2019s most delicious bowl of Japanese-French seafood soup. Mr. Kinch, I concluded, was the savior sent to bring California cuisine into the 21st century.\n\nTwo years later, in December 2012, a magazine editor said that he could expense a Manresa dinner for the two of us. He suggested that we bring (and pay for) our spouses. I had never once eaten at a restaurant of that caliber on my own dime because I did not make nearly enough money. But I liked this editor, I loved Mr. Kinch and I calculated that my one-quarter share of the evening\u2019s total would be $200. I decided to make it a once-in-a-lifetime splurge. After we sat down, Mr. Kinch emerged and said something like, \u201cWith your permission, I would love to create a special tasting menu for your table.\u201d Because the editor and I were pampered food-media professionals, we took this to mean something like, Don\u2019t sweat the prices on the menu; let\u2019s have fun, and I\u2019ll make the bill reasonable.\n\nThe meal lasted five hours, consisted of more than 20 fantastic courses, and we all felt that we had eaten perhaps the greatest meal of our lives. Then the bill came: $1,200, with tax and tip. It turned out that \u201ca special tasting menu\u201d was a price point marked on the menu. My editor friend confessed that he could charge only $400 to his corporate card, and I felt sick with self-loathing. I knew this was my fault \u2014 not Mr. Kinch\u2019s \u2014 and I looked around the dining room at loving couples, buoyant double dates, even a family with two young children for whom a thousand-dollar meal was no stretch. I had been a fool in more ways than I could count, including my delusion that one could think and talk about food outside of its social and economic context.\n\nLike any artisan whose trade depends upon expensive materials and endless work, every chef who plays that elite-level game must cultivate patrons. That means surrounding food with a choreographed theater of luxury in which every course requires a skilled server to set down fresh cutlery and then return with clean wine glasses. A midcareer professional sommelier then must fill those wine glasses and deliver a learned lecture about that next wine\u2019s origin and flavor. Another person on a full-time salary with benefits must then set down art-piece ceramic plates that are perfectly selected to flatter the next two-mouthful course. Yet another midcareer professional must then explain the rare and expensive plants and proteins that have been combined through hours of time-consuming techniques to create the next exquisitely dense compression of value that each diner will devour in moments. Those empty plates and glasses must then be cleared to repeat this cycle again and again, hour after hour.\n\nIn the case of Northern California, these restaurants must satisfy a venture-capital and post-I.P.O. crowd for whom a $400 dinner does not qualify as conspicuous consumption and for whom the prevailing California-lifestyle fantasy is less about heirloom tomatoes than recognizing inefficiencies in the international medical technology markets, flying first-class around the planet to cut deals at three-Michelin-Star restaurants in Hong Kong or London and then, back home, treating the kids to casual $2,000 Sunday suppers.\n\nThe foragers and farmers and fishermen of the old Chez Panisse fantasy still figure, but now as an unseen impecunious peasant horde combing beaches and redwoods for the chanterelles and Santa Barbara spot prawns that genius chefs transform into visionary distillations of a mythical Northern California experience that no successful entrepreneur would waste time living.\n\nIn a normal metropolitan area, super-upscale places like Manresa have such narrow profit margins that ambitious young chefs open them mostly to establish their reputations; later, to pay the mortgage, they open a profitable mid-range joint nearby. According to Mr. Patterson, the opposite is now true in tech-boom San Francisco.\n\n\u201cBusy high-end places are doing fine because they have more ways to control their costs, but the mid-level is getting killed,\u201d Mr. Patterson told me. \u201cI\u2019ve heard guys say they\u2019re doing eight million a year in sales and bringing home less than 2 percent as profit.\u201d As a result, high-end places are proliferating. A partial list would include Coi, Benu, Atelier Crenn, Mosu and Saison, at which dinner for one runs $641 all-in. (Manresa is now comparable.)\n\nMeanwhile, those so-called midlevel restaurants \u2014 by which I mean restaurants that cater to the merely loaded \u2014 exhibit all the innovative exuberance and anxiety of the tech-employee class for whom money would be abundant if not for the cost of local living. On the upside, that cohort\u2019s meritocratic multiculturalism, its \u201cyou do you\u201d faith that anybody might have a million-dollar idea, has encouraged an inclusive culinary scene that supports fantastic upscale Mexican places like Cala and Californios, countless soothingly hip Japanese restaurants like Izakaya Rintaro, intensely flavored street-market Thai at Hawker Fare and what has to be the planet\u2019s most interesting upscale Hawaiian comfort food at Liholiho Yacht Club. Nobody calls any of these restaurants \u201cethnic,\u201d and taken together, they give San Francisco dining the most cosmopolitan feel it has ever had.\n\nOn the downside, in a perfect parallel to the tech sector, the San Francisco restaurant industry has the worst racial and ethnic pay gap in the United States, and the average cook\u2019s salary of about $53,000 doesn\u2019t nearly cover the $3,490 average rent for a one-bedroom apartment. In San Francisco, where public transportation shuts down at midnight and barely reaches the satellite cities that are going through their own real-estate booms, it is essentially impossible for cooks to work downtown and live anywhere reasonably close. As a result, restaurant owners talk about creating dormitory-style housing for employees. Others say that five years ago, when they listed a job opening, they got 50 qualified applicants; now they get five or six.\n\nI am all in favor of San Francisco\u2019s $13 per hour minimum wage (which rises to $15 by 2018), plus mandatory paid sick leave, parental leave and employer health care contributions. But labor costs at restaurants are inching past 50 percent of total expenditures, an indicator of poor fiscal health. Commercial rents have also gone bananas. Add the ever-rising cost of fris\u00e9e and pastured quail eggs and it\u2019s no wonder that many restaurants are experimenting with that unique form of sadism known as \u201csmall plate sharing,\u201d which amounts to offering a big group of hungry people something tiny to divvy up. Even nontrendy joints now ask $30 for a proper entree \u2014 a price point, according to Mr. Patterson, that encourages even affluent customers to discover the joys of home cooking.\n\nTHIS is all fine at the handful of places that are full and profitable every night \u2014 State Bird Provisions, Lazy Bear \u2014 but, according to Gwyneth Borden of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, an alarming number are not. The bigger tech companies worsen the problem by scooping up culinary talent to run lavish free food programs that, as Ms. Borden said, offer workers \u201call-day bacon and lobster rolls and tacos.\u201d This kills the incentive for employees to spend a penny in restaurants, especially at lunch. (Ms. Borden also told me that she can\u2019t count the number of times she has heard an Uber or Lyft driver confess to being a former chef.)\n\nConstant traffic jams and great restaurants in less congested cities like Oakland discourage suburbanites who used to cross the Bay Bridge for date night in San Francisco. Besides, as Mr. Patterson says, the city clears out on holiday weekends. \u201cThey all go to Tahoe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to get a reservation somewhere?

Google accomplishes this by taking a screenshot of every webpage in its index and giving users access to it via a magnifying glass icon that sits to the right of every search result.\n\nWhen a user clicks or hovers over the magnifying glass, a screenshot of the webpage in question will appear on the right side of the search results page. It\u2019s an at-a-glance view of the website\u2019s content without actually having to visit the webpage.\n\nThe key element to Instant Previews though is that Google highlights the section of the page where the search term occurs. Imagine you\u2019re trying to find information on a specific person on a page that lists dozens or hundreds of people. Instead of having to scroll through the entire page to find the person, you can just look at the Instant Preview and see where they are on the page.\n\n\u201cThis is the next evolution of finding a result on a search engine results page,\u201d distinguished engineer Ben Gomes told me yesterday.\n\nGomes says that there are a few specific use cases where Instant Previews are especially useful. One example he offered is when you\u2019re looking for specific charts, graphs or pictures, Instant Previews will show you where the search term occurs and you\u2019ll quickly see whether the graph is appropriate to your search or not. Another is people search; by using Instant Preview, a user can quickly scan the page and find out if the page is about the person they\u2019re looking for.\n\nGomes explained Instant Previews to me as a natural progression for \u201cthe evolution of speed.\u201d Google has an obsession with making search faster, and he cited Autocomplete and Google Instant as examples.\n\nInstant Previews doesn\u2019t focus on speeding up the actual searching of terms though, but rather the decision-making process of choosing a result. Google currently provides a lot of \u201csnippet\u201d data to help. At one time search engines just displayed the first two lines from a webpage under a search result, but now they include information like sitelinks, date, cached content, jump to links and even Google Places. Instant Previews now takes that snippet and puts it in context with the rest of the page.\n\nIs the new feature going to really speed up the user\u2019s search experience, or is it yet another complicated layer on what was once a simple and easy-to-understand search interface? That\u2019s up to users to decide, but Google\u2019s internal testing shows that people using Instant Previews are 5% more likely to be satisfied with the search results they click. While 5% may not sound like much, for a search engine with Google\u2019s scale, that could make all the difference against its chief rival Bing, which has turned to Facebook to make searches more relevant.", "summary": "Google, in its insatiable quest to create a speedier and more useful user experience, is launching a new \u201cinstant preview\u201d feature to help users choose between search results.", "density": 17.7272727273, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 17.8787878788, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/world/asia/01thai.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2008073119id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/world/asia/01thai.html", "title": "Thaksin\u2019s Wife Guilty of Tax Evasion", "date": "2008073119", "text": "Four corruption cases have been filed against Mr. Thaksin, two against his wife and three against two of his children.

His critics say he has played each role to enhance the other, using his wealth to further his political career and using his government position to increase his wealth. He was ousted after months of demonstrations accusing him of misrule and corruption, particularly the $2.2 billion tax-free sale of his telecommunications company, Shin Corporation, to a Singaporean company.\n\nBefore the coup, Mr. Thaksin was listed as the country\u2019s fourth richest person. The government has frozen $2 billion of his family\u2019s assets and he is now counted the 16th richest.\n\nMs. Pojaman was convicted, with her brother and her secretary, of colluding to evade millions of dollars in taxes in 1997 by transferring shares in the family business to one of the family\u2019s maids. The Assets Examination Committee determined last year that a check issued to the maid was deposited in a bank account belonging to Ms. Pojaman.\n\nHer brother, Bhanapot Damapong, was sentenced, like her, to three years in prison, and her secretary, Pennapa Honghern, to two years. All denied the charges.\n\n\u201cThe three defendants have high economic and social status,\u201d said Judge Pramote Pipatpramote, adding that they should have aspired to set an example for society. \u201cBut they were working together to avoid taxes, even though the taxes amounted to little compared to their assets.\u201d\n\nThe stern words were a sharp contrast to the attitude of the courts in 2001, when Mr. Thaksin, newly elected as prime minister, was acquitted of a similar shell game of asset transfers to his maid, driver, relatives and others to evade conflict-of-interest laws.\n\n\u201cThaksin is not disheartened,\u201d his spokesman, Pongthep Thepkanjana, said after the verdict. \u201cThey respect the court ruling, but it is not the end.

(Pete Marovich/Bloomberg)\n\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) is inclined to recall Internal Revenue Service official Lois G. Lerner to testify before his panel, but will await recommendations from committee lawyers, the nonpartisan House Counsel, other outside legal experts and committee Democrats before making a final decision, he said Thursday.\n\nLerner invoked the Fifth Amendment in her refusal to testify before the oversight panel Wednesday, but the fact that she gave a lengthy opening statement defending herself and verbally verified the contents of a document prompted Issa and others to suggest she had inadvertently waived her right against self-incrimination.\n\nIssa told reporters Thursday that he is inclined to agree with GOP lawmakers who raised a point of order during the hearing and objected to Issa\u2019s decision to dismiss Lerner.\n\n\u201cThis is a big thing that we want to get right,\u201d Issa said Thursday. \u201cWe were prepared to accept her asserting her Fifth Amendment rights, but she did these other things and we just want to have it right.\u201d\n\nIssa decided to recess Wednesday\u2019s hearing instead of formally adjourning the proceedings as he awaits the recommendations of lawyers.\n\nPressed on whether he would recall Lerner, Issa said that \u201cProcedurally, I believe it may in all likelihood be necessary to finish the hearing. If it\u2019s not, I wouldn\u2019t do it, but if it is, we\u2019ll bring her back for that reason.\u201d\n\nIn effect, Issa and his lawyers are mulling whether Lerner\u2019s detailed opening statement could be interpreted as a \u201csubject matter waiver,\u201d meaning she had made factual statements about the case, which then opened the door for the committee to ask her for more details.\n\nBut Lerner\u2019s lawyer, William W. Taylor, disagrees with this analysis, and it is unclear whether she will willingly return to testify. If she refuses, the committee would have to order her in contempt of Congress, and a judge would have to rule in favor of the order if it\u2019s challenged.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), who is the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, said he didn\u2019t think Issa \u201cwants to go that far\u201d in seeking a judge\u2019s opinion.\n\n\u201cWe are in search of the truth, because we are trying to reestablish trust in the IRS. But in the United States, there\u2019s something called the United States Constitution that we must adhere to even under these trying times,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nCummings, an attorney, said he had \u201cabsolutely no doubt\u201d that Lerner did not waive her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nIn the course of her opening statement, Lerner, the head of the IRS division on tax-exempt organizations, told members of the committee, \u201cI have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.\u201d", "summary": "House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) is awaiting recommendations from lawyers before making a decision.", "density": 10.88, "coverage": 0.96, "compression": 25.2, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/15/boeing-airbus-talk-profits-over-orders-in-paris.html", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20150929010750id_/http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/15/boeing-airbus-talk-profits-over-orders-in-paris.html", "title": "Boeing, Airbus talk profits over orders in Paris", "date": "20150929010750", "text": "\"We have a huge order book so we believe that the trend of the market is still extremely positive,\" said Fabrice Bregier, CEO of Airbus.\n\nInvestors should have confidence Airbus and Boeing can keep their profit margins up as they expand production, according to Bregier.\n\nRead MoreAirlines are losing altitude.

Grace went to the minors, only to return on May 2, forcing the trade of Durham 17 days later.\n\nThe players union stewed over the turn of events, believing that the Cubs started Grace in the minors to delay his arbitration eligibility by one year. Grace, in the recollection of one agent, became the \u201cposter child\u201d in the union\u2019s fight during the 1990 labor talks to make 17 percent of the two-year players arbitration-eligible.\n\nAnd now, as history repeats with another Cubs phenom, the union must fight again.\n\nIf Kris Bryant starts the season at Triple-A, the union should file a grievance to restore his lost service time, even though it would stand little chance of winning the case.\n\nThe old union leaders \u2014 Marvin Miller, Donald Fehr, et al \u2014 never backed down, always supporting players on issues of principle, regardless of the anticipated outcome.\n\nThe relationship between the players and owners is less combative now, to the benefit of all. But the union\u2019s mission \u2014 to protect the rights of its players \u2014 remains an important part of the industry\u2019s give-and-take.\n\nNew union chief Tony Clark should embrace the pending Bryant absurdity as the perfect opportunity to take a stand, knowing that bigger fights lie ahead with the collective-bargaining agreement expiring in 2016.\n\nBryant, 23, leads the majors with eight home runs this spring. He is one of the Cubs\u2019 25 best players, maybe their best position player, period. And yet, he is almost certain to follow the path of Grace before him, and start the season at Triple-A.\n\nCubs president Theo Epstein says that the Bryant decision will be a baseball decision, and that the third baseman still must improve his defense. But it is not nearly that simple, as everyone in the industry knows.\n\nIf the Cubs postpone Bryant\u2019s major-league arrival for at least 12 days, it will enable them to gain an additional year of control over the player before he becomes a free agent, according to baseball\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement.\n\nWhy won\u2019t Epstein simply acknowledge service-time considerations with Bryant? Presumably for the same reason that other executives follow the same script when dealing with the same situation: Concern that the union would use such remarks as grounds for a grievance.\n\nSo, the explanation for the act might trigger a grievance, but the actual act wouldn\u2019t?\n\nThe refusal of executives to discuss the service-time question indicates that management has some degree of doubt about the legality of its position. The union\u2019s argument would be that the Cubs are operating outside the spirit of the CBA, demoting Bryant not because he needs to improve as a player, but because they want control over him for an additional year.\n\nThe case law overwhelmingly favors the clubs, according to one source \u2014 as long as there is a reasonable basis for the decision, even if it is wrong, the club will prevail. No matter. A grievance would demonstrate to both the players and owners \u2014 louder than any verbal threats \u2014 that the new union leadership will not be a pushover come 2016.\n\nGranted, a player\u2019s spring home run total tells us only so much about his performance, particularly a player\u2019s spring homer total in Arizona. Still, no major-league spring homer leader has failed to make an Opening Day roster since STATS LLC began tracking the data in 1996.\n\n*By clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nEpstein points out that two players he helped develop \u2014 Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia and Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo \u2014 benefited from significant time at Triple-A. But there also are examples of players who had fewer than Bryant\u2019s 297 plate appearances at Triple-A \u2014 and became stars.\n\nThe list includes Mike Trout, Miguel Cabrera and Giancarlo Stanton, plus Albert Pujols, Justin Upton and many others. Bryant is at least two years older than all of those players were at the times of their debuts, and less of a defensive question than some. Pujols did not even have a set position his first season. Cabrera played three games in left field at Double-A before assuming that spot for the Marlins full time.\n\nMeanwhile, Bryant\u2019s teammate, Jorge Soler, had only 127 plate appearances at Triple-A before the Cubs promoted him last Aug. 27. The difference between Soler and Bryant, who did not receive a September call-up, is obvious. Soler signed a nine-year contract that began in 2012, so the Cubs need not worry about whether the will become a free agent in six or seven years.\n\nMake no mistake: If I were Epstein, I would handle this exactly the same way, particularly knowing that Bryant\u2019s agent, Scott Boras, generally prefers his clients to establish their values on the open market rather than accept long-term extensions.\n\nSome Cubs veterans believe that the team should make a statement by keeping Bryant, and demonstrate that the franchise\u2019s sole objective is to win a World Series for the first time since 1908. Well, do the math: The Cubs would sacrifice two weeks at the start of Bryant\u2019s career to ensure keeping him through his age-29 season.

And yet the watchmaker Richard Mille, whose Swiss brand is best known for fashioning avant-garde timepieces from space-age materials, found enough similarities between the two worlds to co-design a watch with Airbus Corporate Jets, or ACJ.\n\nAs the ACJ managing director, Benoit Defforge, put it: \u201cWe have the same kind of customer.\u201d\n\nThe result of their two-year collaboration, introduced at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva in January, is the 30-piece limited edition RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph, available exclusively at Richard Mille boutiques for a staggering $1.05 million.\n\nThe relationship between the two brands, neither of which had ever engaged in a partnership of this nature, began after a friend of Mr. Mille\u2019s put him in touch with Mr. Defforge. For the French watchmaker, teaming with the aircraft manufacturer based in Toulouse, France, was something of a fantasy. \u201cI\u2019m totally mad about Airbus,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a hundred times around the globe. Still, when I see their aircraft I am like a baby.\u201d\n\nThe challenge was \u201cto identify the parts of the plane that you could bring to a watch,\u201d Mr. Defforge said. \u201cWe wanted to give the feeling that this watch is an Airbus Corporate Jet, not a watch with Airbus Corporate Jets written on it.\u201d\n\nSylvain Mariat, head of ACJ\u2019s corporate design studio, took the first stab at creating a lightweight skeletonized model. He constructed a case from a titanium-aluminum alloy, the same material Airbus uses for jet turbine blades, added a ceramic bezel shaped like an airplane window, and then replaced Richard Mille\u2019s signature screws with Torq-Set screws used by Airbus.\n\nMr. Mariat, working in concert with Julien Boillat and Salvador Arbona at Richard Mille, translated the massive structures used to attach wings to the aircraft engine into pushers on the sides of the watch and finished the timepiece with a jet engine-inspired crown marked with the Airbus logo.\n\nThe complex split-seconds chronograph movement inside the case boasts numerous concessions to energy efficiency: The titanium reduces internal friction, and several of its bridges have been treated with an aeronautical coating used to protect engine and chassis parts from corrosion.\n\nBeyond promoting the timepiece at aviation industry events, such as the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition in Geneva in May, Mr. Defforge said Airbus would let Mr. Mille handle distribution and sales. And even though the luxury watch industry is facing a tough economic environment this year, Mr. Mille does not appear concerned by the prospect of selling 30 million-dollar timepieces.\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel guilty, because 2015 has been incredible for us,\u201d he said, speaking from a health clinic in Germany, where he was on a 15-day fast with his American business partner and distributor, John Simonian. \u201cEvery day we have soup at lunch, every night he is pushing me for deliveries.\u201d", "summary": "A two-year collaboration between the watchmaker and the aircraft manufacturer produced a 30-piece limited edition.", "density": 2.3888888889, "coverage": 0.9444444444000001, "compression": 32.9444444444, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/chicago-police-shooting-antwon-golatte-unjustified", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2016072619id_/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/chicago-police-shooting-antwon-golatte-unjustified", "title": "Why a black man shot by Chicago police believes his case may be a sign of change", "date": "2016072619", "text": "Antwon Golatte lifted his shirt to reveal the wide, dark scars of three bullet holes and two surgeries.\n\n\u201cI always said I was innocent,\u201d said Golatte, 35, speaking to reporters for the first time since he was shot by police officers on the south side of Chicago in February 2015.\n\nOn Thursday, the city\u2019s independent police review authority (IPRA) ruled that officers were unjustified in shooting Golatte. Their investigation contradicted officers\u2019 contention that they shot him in self-defense, believing that Golatte was trying to run them over with his SUV.\n\nRelated: The hidden: how Chicago police kept thousands isolated at Homan Square\n\n\u201cIt was real, real painful \u2026 walking is hard for me, I can\u2019t sit or stand for long periods of time, I have permanent nerve damage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he thinks about the incident every day. \u201cI\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d\n\nBut Golatte and his lawyers said they think IPRA\u2019s ruling signals that the movement for police accountability in Chicago may finally be having some effect.\n\n\u201cIf IPRA is going to start stepping forward and giving some kind of fairness back to communities and other cities start following their lead, that stops all this chaos and madness out there of cops versus communities,\u201d said Chris Stewart, an Atlanta-based attorney working with Golatte who also represents the family of Alton Sterling, killed by police in Baton Rouge earlier this month. \u201cBecause all people in communities want to know is we\u2019re going to be treated fairly \u2026 If someone gets shot, investigate fairly. That\u2019s pretty reasonable.\u201d\n\nIn December, Mayor Rahm Emanuel replaced the head of the oversight board with former federal prosecutor Sharon Fairley. Since Fairley took over, IPRA has found three shootings by police unjustified, compared with finding only two shootings unjustified between 2007 and the end of 2015.\n\nThe vindication for Golatte comes after what he described as a long history of police harassment. He said officers sat in their cars for hours outside his home, and searched the building he rented out to tenants.\n\nTwo days before the shooting, Golatte\u2019s attorney Danielle Pinkston said, the same officers had searched Golatte\u2019s car without a warrant, while he left it running to warm up before taking a friend to the store.\n\nGolatte said he felt police were trying to punish him for past transgressions \u2013 a period when he was \u201crunning with the wrong crowd\u201d \u2013 even though he had turned his life around. And though he said he documented the alleged harassment, he never considered making a complaint to IPRA.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, in the inner city you just suck it up,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cBecause you know if you go tell, if you go to the police station, they\u2019re going to say \u2018get out of here\u2019 or just ignore you.\u201d\n\nWhen officers pulled Golatte over on 7 February 2015, during what they described as a narcotics investigation, Golatte said, \u201cI knew that my life was in danger. There wasn\u2019t a shadow of a doubt.\u201d\n\nGolatte is still facing four felony charges of aggravated battery to peace officers and a charge of damage to government property, Pinkston said. She said they are demanding state\u2019s attorney Anita Alvarez drop the charges in light of IPRA\u2019s findings. Alvarez is in her last months on the job, as she lost a Democratic primary amid allegations that she was too lenient on officers accused of misconduct.\n\nStewart said Golatte has trouble finding a job because employers find news stories describing the officers\u2019 allegations, now debunked by IPRA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cIf you look him up online, it looks like he tried to run over four officers \u2026 And it\u2019s just not true.\u201d\n\nGolatte said he wants to see all four officers involved in his shooting dropped from the force.\n\nRelated: The Counted: people killed by police in the United States \u2013 interactive\n\nA Chicago police department spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said: \u201c[the department] will be reviewing the investigative findings and conferring with IPRA on any disciplinary recommendations. It is premature for us to make any additional comment at this point.\u201d\n\nThe officers who fired their weapons at Golatte are Jaime Gaeta and Harry Matheos.\n\nThe other two officers involved were not named publicly. The Citizens Police Data Project, a database run by the not-for-profit Invisible Institute, lists 20 misconduct complaints against Gaeta, including 13 wrongful use of force complaints. IPRA found one of the complaints sustained, a 2010 incident involving mishandling and premature discharge of a gun, with no one injured. The data project shows 14 misconduct complaints naming Matheos, including multiple illegal search complaints and one alleging unjustified use of force. IPRA did not find any of those complaints sustained.\n\nEmanuel has promised to replace IPRA entirely with an independent civilian police review council. Residents have long been calling for such a council, and the proposal gained steam after the release last fall of a video of officer Jason Van Dyke gunning down Laquan McDonald.\n\nEven as reforms move forward, new proposals have threatened to move progress in the other direction. The city council is considering an ordinance known as Blue Lives Matter, similar to proposals nationwide, that would designate attacks on officers and firefighters as hate crimes.\n\nSince Wednesday, activists and victims of police misconduct have been occupying an area outside the Homan Square police facility to protest against that ordinance. The Homan Square site on the city\u2019s west side has long been used for interrogations, often for prolonged periods, without lawyers being notified or granted access and without charges being filed, as the Guardian first reported.", "summary": "An investigation has ruled that the shooting of Antwon Golatte by police was unjustified.

CLICK HERE TO JOIN!\n\nMaster Sgt. Nathan Sommers, a decorated soloist with the Army Band, is being charged under a federal law that permits commanding officers to conduct non-judicial proceedings for minor offenses.\n\nSommers is accused of giving a superior officer the wrong date for a doctor\u2019s appointment. He\u2019s also accused of failing to carry out an order. In order to comply with that order, Sommers would have had to disclose private information about his autistic son\u2019s medical records.\n\nThe charges were handed down one day after Sommers told Fox News that he was facing discrimination and persecution because of his conservative political and religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe timing does seem strange,\u201d retired Navy Commander John Bennett Wells told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s suspicious. No matter what\u2019s happening it looks like a graduated attempt to build a case against him on some really ridiculous charges.\n\nWells is representing the 25-year veteran who, until last summer, had a spotless record.\n\nThe Military District of Washington disputed allegations that Sommers had been reprimanded or disciplined.\n\n\u201cThe Soldier is not, and never has been, \u2018facing retribution and punishment from the military for having anti-Obama bumper stickers on his car, reading books written by conservative authors like Mark Levin and David Limbaugh, and serving Chick-fil-A sandwiches at his promotion party,\u2019\u201d Public Affairs Director Michelle Roberts told Fox News in a written statement.\n\nHowever, Wells said that\u2019s simply not true \u2013 and he said he\u2019s got official Army documents to support his claims.\n\nThe MDW spokesman was either uninformed or was being disingenuous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe counseling form clearly stated that he was being reminded of his limited ability to disagree with the President\u2019s policies and implied that displaying the bumper stickers could lead to prosecution under the Hatch Act.\u201d\n\nHe said the counseling form also reprimanded Sommers for tweeting about the Chick-fil-A party.\n\n\u201cThe counseling form in itself is firm corroboration of the statements made by MSG Sommers to Fox News,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also gives rise to the question of why the Army was data mining a soldier\u2019s private tweets.\u201d\n\nSommers\u2019 troubles started last year when he was confronted about having pro-Republican and anti-Obama bumper stickers on his personal vehicle.\n\nThe stickers read: \u201cPolitical Dissent is NOT Racism,\u201d \u201cNOBAMA,\u201d NOPE2012\u201d and \u201cThe Road to Bankruptcy is Paved with Ass-Fault.\u201d That sticker included the image of a donkey.\n\nHis superior officer told the solider that the bumper stickers were creating \u201cunnecessary workplace tension.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe types of stickers on your car were creating an atmosphere detrimental to morale and were creating unnecessary workplace tension,\u201d the officer wrote in an Army document obtained by Fox News. \u201cA Soldier must balance their personal feelings with the mission of the U.S. Army. Even the slightest inference of disrespect towards superiors can have a demoralizing effect on the unit.\u201d\n\nSommers also came under fire for reading the works of Mark Levin, Sean Hannity and David Limbaugh. Last summer he was reading Limbaugh\u2019s \u201cThe Great Destroyer\u201d backstage at a concert when a superior officer told him that he was causing \u201cunit disruption\u201d and was offending other soldiers.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t read aloud,\u201d Sommers told Fox News. \u201cI was just reading privately to myself. I was told they were frowning on that and they warned me that I should not be reading literature like that backstage because it was offensive.\u201d\n\nFox News Channel host Sean Hannity expressed dismay at the book censorship.\n\n\u201cWhat a sad day for American when an American hero can have his personal freedoms ripped away \u2013 when that very military he works for is on the frontlines defending those very freedoms for every United States citizen,\u201d Hannity told Fox News. \u201cWhat\u2019s next \u2013 book burning? Government approved reading lists? State run media outlets? Can military members read Obama\u2019s books?\u201d\n\nBut the incident that led to an official investigation of Sommers came late last summer when he served Chick-fil-A sandwiches at his promotion party.\n\nHis promotion coincided with a controversy surrounding Chick-fil-A. The company\u2019s president told a reporter that he was \u201cguilty as charged\u201d when it came to supporting traditional marriage. Gay rights activists pounced- calling for a boycott of the Christian-owned company. And some Democratic officials vowed to block Chick-fil-A from opening restaurants in their cities.\n\nIn response to that, Fox News Channel host Mike Huckabee launched a national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day to rally support for the restaurant chain.\n\n\u201cI was inspired by Gov. Huckabee\u2019s appreciation day,\u201d Sommers told Fox News. \u201cAnd since I wasn\u2019t able to participate in the event, I decided to serve Chick-fil-A at my promotion party.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a long-standing tradition within the U.S. Army Band for promoted soldiers to host a party for their fellow troops. So the soldier decided to have Chick-fil-A cater the meal.\n\n\u201cMy family likes Chick-fil-A and we like what they stand for,\u201d he said. \u201cI can make a statement and at least express a religious point of view at my promotion party \u2013 theoretically without any fear of reprisal.\u201d\n\nThe soldier also tweeted about the party: \u201cIn honor of DADT repeal, and Obama/Holder\u2019s refusal to enforce DOMA act, I\u2019m serving Chick-fil-A at my MSG promo reception for Army today.\u201d\n\nHe also tweeted to radio host Mark Levin: \u201c@Marklevinshow \u2018luv ya, Mark! Fellow Virginian & MSG, Army. Being promoted today, serving Chick-fil-A @ reception in honor of DADT repeal.\u201d\n\nBoth tweets were cited in an official military document.\n\n\u201cAs a Soldier you must be cognizant of the fact that your statements can be perceived by the general public and other service members to be of a nature bordering on disrespect to the President of the United States,\u201d the document stated.\n\nSommers said he paid for the party with personal money, not government funds.\n\n\u201cI had no idea a Chick-fil-A sandwich would get me in trouble,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was later summoned by a superior officer, who the soldier said is openly gay, and was told that unidentified individuals were offended by the tweets and some considered them to be racist.\n\nSommers was reprimanded, threatened with judicial action and given a bad efficiency report. An investigation was also launched.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an obvious attempt to set him up and force him out of the military,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThey recently did an NCO evaluation that effectively torpedoed his chance at promotion and he could be forced out of the Army.\u201d\n\nAttorney Wells believes Sommers is being discriminated against not only because of his Christian faith, but also because of his objections to homosexuality.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Wells told Fox News. \u201cBecause he is religious, because he feels that homosexual conduct is wrong for religious reasons, he is basically being persecuted.\u201d\n\nDuring the course of their investigation, the military unearthed a tweet from 2010 that included a derogatory word for homosexuals. The soldier admitted that he had retweeted someone else\u2019s original tweet.\n\n\u201cLordy, Lordy, it\u2019s faggot Tuesday. The lefty loons and Obamabots are out in full force,\u201d the retweet read.\n\nThe soldier was hauled in to explain himself before a superior officer.\n\n\u201cHe explained to me that homosexual Soldiers were now afraid of me,\u201d Sommers said. \u201cHe showed me a letter from an Army Band colleague that demanded that I publicly apologize (to) the band for my statements and that I should be removed from positions of leadership and influence.\u201d\n\nSommers admitted the retweet was a case of bad judgment on his part, but he said he believes that a group of homosexual soldiers are on a witch hunt and they were \u201cattempting to dig up any negative information they could in order to silence me or ruin my career.\u201d\n\nWells said there are a number of homosexuals serving in the Army Band and he believes they are ganging up on Sommers because of his religious beliefs.\n\nLast Spring Sommers raised concerns after the US Army Chorus had been invited to perform with the Turtle Creek Chorale, one of the nation\u2019s largest gay men\u2019s choruses.\n\nSommers said he witnessed an \u201cinappropriate sexual advance between one of the members of the chorale\u201d and a member of the US Army Chorus involving a slap on a soldier\u2019s backside.\n\n\u201cThe rehearsal also featured sexual innuendo and banter which made me feel particularly uncomfortable, and a situation where a 10-year-old boy, who was asked to sing a solo with the Turtle Creek Chorale, was subjected to inappropriate, lewd behavior from the Chorale in the presence of the Army Chorus,\u201d he said.\n\nWells said he witnessed similar behavior on an Army base involving two men exchanging affectionate words.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the military any kind of public display of affection on a military installation would have been discouraged and frowned upon,\u201d Wells said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s blatant. I\u2019m not sure heterosexuals can do that.\u201d\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin told Fox News it appears the Army is trying to send a message to not only Sommers but others in his unit.\n\n\u201cOver my 36 years in the US Army I saw numerous situations like this where a soldier is singled out by the chain of command for punishment,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cThe Article 15 proceeding may be technically legitimate, but one must recognize that an Army Master Sergeant with 25 years does not normally do stupid things that are easily avoidable unless there is some mitigating circumstance.\u201d\n\nBoykin said the issue is whether the chain of command would be doing this if it were not for his outspoken Christian faith and his unwillingness to compromise on what he believes.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that the chain of command has failed to deter him from his beliefs and has resorted to this step now,\u201d he said.\n\nTODD IS THE AUTHOR OF DISPATCHES FROM BITTER AMERICA \u2013 ENDORSED BY SARAH PALIN, SEAN HANNITY AND MARK LEVIN.

Senator Ted Cruz decisively won caucuses in Maine and Kansas on Saturday, but Donald J. Trump triumphed in Kentucky\u2019s caucuses and Louisiana\u2019s primary, maintaining his lead in the delegate count. The results were a stinging setback for Marco Rubio, who finished distantly behind both. The schism between the Republican Party\u2019s elite and its rank-and-file members is deepening as Mr. Trump keeps gaining momentum.\n\n2. Bernie Sanders won Saturday\u2019s Kansas and Nebraska Democratic caucuses, while Hillary Clinton won the Louisiana primaries. Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton will debate twice this week. Their first matchup comes tonight in Flint, Mich., where government failures at the local, state and federal level contributed to the city\u2019s water crisis.\n\n3. Anxiety about the economy is a constant topic on the campaign trail, but the latest monthly jobs report was filled with positive signs. The private sector added 242,000 workers in February and recorded 72 months of uninterrupted job gains, the longest streak on record. The unemployment rate stands at 4.9 percent, down from 8.3 percent at this point four years ago, during the last presidential election cycle.\n\n4. The economy is also a talking point at the National People\u2019s Congress, the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature. Though the 3,000 delegates hold little real power, the meeting outlines the government\u2019s priorities. China is planning for an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent over the next five years, but the income of many state-owned corporations is plunging, and the government plans to cut production in coal, steel, cement and other industries.\n\n5. Tuesday is the second anniversary of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\u2019s disappearance. Only one confirmed scrap of debris from the plane has been located \u2014 a wing part that washed ashore in July on a French island \u2014 but a triangular object found last week may be another piece of the puzzle. Blaine Alan Gibson, a lawyer from Seattle, found the debris in Mozambique, where he had traveled to look for wreckage.\n\n6. President Obama will host a state dinner on Thursday for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the first since 1997 held for a Canadian leader. Elected five months ago, Mr. Trudeau has already begun to develop a close relationship with his American counterpart. \u201cHe said that seeing my family on TV on election night reminded him of his election in 2008 with his family,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, describing their first phone conversation.\n\n7. The Supreme Court appears sharply divided over a landmark abortion case concerning a Texas law that would force the closure of clinics unable to meet strict standards. To fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, President Obama is vetting several appellate and trial court judges. Senate Democrats and Republicans are preparing for a bare-knuckle brawl over the nominee\u2019s confirmation.\n\n8. Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors star, broke his own N.B.A. record last week for most 3-pointers in a single season. His playing style is so distinctive and his achievements so outsize that statisticians and sports historians are struggling to contextualize his breakout. LeBron James tweeted his admiration: \u201cNever before seen someone like him in the history of ball!\u201d\n\n9. Alex Rodriguez hit a home run for the Yankees in his first at-bat of this year\u2019s spring training games. For the Mets, the slugger Yoenis Cespedes kept things interesting by arriving at camp in a succession of customized luxury cars \u2014 and then, for his grand finale, on horseback. The baseball season officially begins on April 3.\n\n10. The lingering chill of winter and the hint of spring warmth create an interesting phenomenon when they collide: ice flowers. These ephemeral blossoms sprout when frigid water seeps out of plant stems and freezes in the cold air. Some of those lucky enough to spot them are sharing their #frostflower photos.\n\n11. The astronaut Scott Kelly returned to Earth after 340 days on the International Space Station. \u201cIt seemed longer than I thought it would be,\u201d he said. NASA and the Russian space agency are studying how extended weightlessness changes bones, muscles, nerves and the cardiovascular system.\n\n12. Another visitor from space is headed toward Earth this week: an asteroid. A chunk of rock the size of a large yacht, 2013 TX68, will soon zip past and could cross through Earth\u2019s ring of geostationary satellites. The asteroid is big enough to demolish a city if it hit the planet, but NASA says we\u2019re safe \u2014 this time.\n\nYour Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWant to look back?

ObamaCare Costs More Than Promised", "date": "2012031519", "text": "Senate Passes Insurance Industry Aid Bill (Photo credit: Mike Licht, NotionsCapital.com)\n\nThis will only come as a surprise to President Obama\u2019s most gullible admirers: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) now claims that the president\u2019s signature health care legislation will cost hundreds of billions of dollars more than originally predicted. So naturally, the media are running headlines claiming ObamaCare will cost less.\n\nNo serious policy person ever believed the original CBO gross cost projection of $938 billion (over 10 years) made when the bill was rammed through Congress in March of 2010. Working to achieve an acceptable CBO \u201cscore\u201d (i.e., cost projection) is just part of the game Washington plays with legislation\u2014and the American people.\n\nTo begin with, the costs in the legislation were back-loaded: Many of the costs won\u2019t emerge until the latter half of the initial 10-year projection, ending in 2019. And sure enough, when the CBO issued its update in March 2011 the 10-year gross cost projection through 2021 jumped to $1.44 trillion. The just-released 2012 projection tags the gross cost at $1.76 trillion through 2022\u2014nearly twice the original cost. Surprise!\n\nGiven that the Obama administration\u2019s federal budget deficit for the month of February was $232 billion, an $800 billion increase in the cost of ObamaCare may seem like chump change\u2014only about three and a half months worth of monthly Obama deficits. Still, I for one can\u2019t help but think of $800 billion as real money.\n\nSo how do the media describe this huge cost increase? Why, as a decrease, of course. The Reuters headline read: \u201cCBO Cuts Cost Estimate for Obama HealthCare Law,\u201d and The Hill asserts, \u201cCBO: Obama Health Law to Cost Less, Cover Fewer People Than First Thought.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, the CBO did say that offsetting savings and revenue enhancements will lower the grand total for the bill, and the media reported some of the sordid details in their stories. But the overall impression was positive, leaving the wrong impression. For example, one source of \u201csavings\u201d\u2014$20 billion\u2014comes from the fact that fewer than projected small businesses are using the tax credit to subsidize health coverage, even though liberal groups (and here on Forbes) tried to convince us it would be otherwise. In reality, this small business-coverage rejection marks a huge failure for the legislation, but the media stories largely ignore that fact.\n\nAnd one of the sources of increased revenue, helping to offset the additional cost, is the increase in penalties on individuals and businesses. The CBO increased its estimated revenues from penalty payments from uninsured individuals from $34 billion (the March 2011 estimate) to $45 billion. The penalties paid by employers not providing coverage jump from $81 billion to $96 billion.\n\nThus, one reason that the projected total cost of ObamaCare goes down is the government plans on raking in $141 billion in penalties imposed on employers and individuals. I\u2019m betting we wont see that at the top of the president\u2019s list of ObamaCare benefits.\n\nAnother reason for the budget changes has to do with the sorry state of the economic recovery. The legislation expands the Medicaid program for low-income Americans and provides subsidies for middle-income families getting coverage through a state health insurance exchange.\n\nPast economic recoveries have been more robust than the current one, in part because they didn\u2019t have to overcome Obama\u2019s economic policies and regulatory smackdowns. Thus economic projections a few years ago turned out to be too optimistic; the CBO now projects more people will be in Medicaid and some 4 million fewer people will be getting health insurance through their jobs. That raised the projected federal Medicaid outlays from $627 billion to $795 billion, and dropped the exchange subsidies from $777 billion to $681 billion\u2014a total additional cost to taxpayers of about $65 billion.", "summary": "While recent headlines about President Obama's health care law seemed positive, a look at the cost projections reveal a program that will cost a lot more than the public was promised.", "density": 1.0882352941, "coverage": 0.7352941176000001, "compression": 22.2941176471, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/nyregion/09officer.html", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2008120919id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/nyregion/09officer.html", "title": "Officers Facing Assault Charges Surrender to Brooklyn D.A.", "date": "2008120919", "text": "Officer Richard Kern surrendered at the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s office early Tuesday morning to face charges for assaulting a man during a police stop on a busy subway platform in October.\n\nAt dawn, he walked in with his attorney, after his two fellow officers, Alex Cruz and Andrew Morales, also surrendered. They are scheduled to face lesser charges of obstruction.\n\nNeither Mr. Kern nor his lawyer, John D. Patten, had any comment. Mr. Cruz, who was accompanied by his lawyer, Stuart London, did not comment either, nor did Mr. Morales.\n\nThe charges are still pending. \u201cThe officers are under arrest now and will be arraigned after an 11 a.m. press conference,\u201d Jonah Bruno, a spokesperson for the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office, said.\n\nJerry Schmetterer, the lead spokesman for the district attorney, said that the officers\u2019 fingerprints will need to go to Albany electronically, following procedure. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the arresting detectives whether or not they will be handcuffed to the wall during the booking,\u201d Mr. Schmetterer said.\n\nIn a statement last month, Officer Kern, 25, said: \u201cI did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the other officers have also said their clients did nothing wrong.\n\nBut a grand jury in Brooklyn last week found enough evidence to charge them in the case of Michael Mineo, a 24-year-old body piercer.\n\nMr. Mineo, whom the police suspected of smoking marijuana, told investigators he was sodomized with an object while the officers grappled with him. A transit officer who took part in the arrest testified that Officer Kern touched Mr. Mineo\u2019s buttocks with his baton.\n\nBut the transit officer waited several days before reporting what he saw, and police officials have said that civilian witnesses initially questioned by the department\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau said they did not see an assault.\n\nThe lawyer for a fourth officer involved in the arrest, Noel Jugraj, said on Monday that his client had also spoken to investigators and did not expect to be charged.\n\n\u201cMy client has been forthcoming from the get-go,\u201d said the lawyer, Edward J. Mandery. \u201cHe did not participate in a crime.\u201d\n\nMr. Mandery would not discuss Officer Jugraj\u2019s account to the grand jury.\n\n\u201cMy client is a decorated officer,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not hurting anyone and he is not protecting anyone. He is going to tell the truth as to what he observed.\u201d\n\nThe Police Department left the officers on active duty for nearly three weeks after the encounter, but has since refused to discuss many of the core facts about their careers, including the number of arrests they have made and whether they have been the subject of any disciplinary actions.\n\nGoing forward, much of the focus of the case will fall on Officer Kern because of the allegation that it was his baton that was reported to have come in contact with Mr. Mineo\u2019s rectum. In recent days, the officer\u2019s colleagues stepped forward to say that those accounts are at odds with the conscientious, responsible man they knew.\n\n\u201cHe just wanted to be a good cop,\u201d recalled Kevin Clark, a retired officer who worked with Officer Kern for about a year in the 71st Precinct.\n\nTwice previously, Officer Kern was accused of using excessive force. but his lawyer said he was cleared in both cases by the Civilian Complaint Review Board. One of the incidents, in 2007, prompted two lawsuits that the city agreed to settle for a total of $50,000.\n\nBut the city said the settlements did not reflect any admission of wrongdoing, and Mr. Kern has called the allegations of excessive force \u201ca complete lie.\u201d The review board declined to discuss the cases.\n\nIn the lawsuits, Officer Kern was accused of making unlawful arrests and manhandling people washing their coats in the laundry room of a Brooklyn housing project. The police were responding to a 911 call, and a resident later signed an affidavit saying the group in the laundry room had no authority to be there.\n\nOn Monday, the lawyer who brought the cases, Richard J. Cardinale, said he had filed a third lawsuit last week stemming from the same case, this time on behalf of Edgar Acuna. Like the two earlier lawsuits, it alleges that Officer Kern struck Mr. Acuna with his gun, unnecessarily sprayed him with Mace and choked him.\n\nSeveral officers mentioned in interviews that Officer Kern, who is slight at 135 pounds, was not someone who typically used his size to overpower suspects. \u201cHe\u2019s real skinny,\u201d said Edwin Boone, a retired sergeant who gave Officer Kern the best evaluation in his 15-person squad.\n\nFriends said Officer Kern grew up in the Woodside section of Queens to a family of modest means. At Holy Cross High School, he ran track, graduated in 2001 and attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice, leaving a few credits shy of his degree.\n\nHe worked briefly in the sports department of The Associated Press, but soon quit to enroll in the Police Academy. Friends say he lives with his parents in Queens while he and his wife save for a house.\n\nHis lawyer said Officer Kern has made 90 arrests, a number that represents the work of a fairly active officer, and had been assigned to an anticrime unit in hopes of qualifying to become a detective.\n\nMick Meenan, Al Baker, Colin Moynihan and William K.

He was 85.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Susan Zachary, his agent, who said the cause had not been determined.\n\nMr. Waite was a respected New York stage actor when he was offered a role on \u201cThe Waltons,\u201d and at first he was not enthusiastic about it. But his agent, he recalled, advised him to take the part so that he could \u201cpick up a couple of bucks\u201d in Hollywood and go back to New York.\n\n\u201cThe Waltons\u201d made its debut on CBS in September 1972 against two already popular shows: Flip Wilson\u2019s irreverent comedy-variety show on NBC and, on ABC, \u201cMod Squad,\u201d a drama about young undercover police officers. What some saw as a cornball newcomer was expected to be buried, but within two seasons it had driven its competitors off the air.\n\nThe success of \u201cThe Waltons\u201d owed much to the actors and the characters they played, members of a homespun rural family used to surmounting challenges through old-fashioned virtues. The foremost was John Jr., known as John-Boy, the oldest of seven children. Played by Richard Thomas, he was a serious young man with a passion to be a writer.\n\nAlmost as significant was Mr. Waite\u2019s John Sr., the family patriarch, who displayed wisdom, goodness, courage and a bit of a temper. He did not approve of hunting animals for sport, but hunted to put food on his hard-pressed family\u2019s table. Though he shunned organized religion, his wife, Olivia, played by Michael Learned, called him \u201cthe most God-fearing man I know.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, a TV Guide poll of readers ranked him No. 3 on its list of the \u201c50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time,\u201d behind Bill Cosby\u2019s Dr. Cliff Huxtable (No. 1) on \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and Lorne Greene\u2019s Ben Cartwright on \u201cBonanza.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Waltons\u201d lasted nine seasons and produced six made-for-television movie sequels.

He was at various times a Marine, a social worker, an ordained Presbyterian minister, a book editor and a three-time Democratic candidate for Congress from California.\n\nAs an actor, he ranged from Shakespeare to Beckett and from Broadway to soap operas, most notably as Father Matt on \u201cDays of Our Lives.\u201d One of his two Emmy nominations was for playing Slater, the first mate of a slave ship, in the 1977 mini-series \u201cRoots\u201d \u2014 a glaring contrast to the broad-minded John Walton. The other was for \u201cThe Waltons.\u201d\n\nHe had small parts in movies like \u201cCool Hand Luke\u201d (1967), with Paul Newman, and \u201cFive Easy Pieces\u201d (1970), with Jack Nicholson. He appeared on television on \u201cMurder One\u201d (1996), as a clergyman on the HBO series \u201cCarniv\u00e0le\u201d (2003-5) and as Jackson Gibbs, the father of Mark Harmon\u2019s character, on \u201cNCIS\u201d (2008-12). He directed 16 episodes of \u201cThe Waltons.\u201d\n\nMr. Waite started the Los Angeles Actors\u2019 Theater, an experimental company, and spent more than $1 million of his own money on a failed 1980 movie about skid-row types. The film, \u201cOn the Nickel,\u201d which he wrote, produced, directed and starred in, appeared in just a few theaters.\n\nRalph Harold Waite was born in White Plains on June 22, 1928, the oldest of five children, and grew up in a \u201cvery secular, nonartistic\u201d environment, he told People magazine in 1977.\n\n\u201cI was never taken to a play or concert or church,\u201d he said. \u201cYet I was a show-off, a dreamer, a storyteller.\u201d\n\nAfter high school he joined the Marines, serving from 1946 to 1948, and attended Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa., where he met Beverly Hall, whom he married in 1951. She encouraged him to go into social work, which he did in Westchester County after graduating in 1952.\n\nTiring of the county bureaucracy, he sought meaning in religion, a reversal of his belief in college that secular philosophy was sufficient. He entered Yale Divinity School and earned a master\u2019s degree. He was ordained a Presbyterian minister and served congregations on Fishers Island, off Long Island, and in Garden City, N.Y.\n\nHe later left the ministry, upset with what he saw as hypocrisy in the church, and worked for Harper & Row editing religious books. That did not satisfy him for long either.\n\nMeanwhile, his marriage deteriorated and he drank too much \u2014 a problem, he said, that worsened until he gave up alcohol in the mid-1970s. A friend suggested he try acting school.\n\n\u201cI was in my 30s and I had never acted before,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 1974. \u201cBut I figured I had nothing to lose, so I went with him. The first time I just listened. The second time I played a scene. The third time I took the bit in my teeth, and I loved it. I felt alive for the first time since I can\u2019t remember when.\u201d\n\nHe impressed his teachers and soon got a job as general understudy in an Off Broadway production of Jean Genet\u2019s \u201cThe Balcony.\u201d By the end of its six-month run, he had played all the major roles.\n\nIn 1965, he received excellent reviews for his performance in William Alfred\u2019s \u201cHogan\u2019s Goat,\u201d a drama about Brooklyn politics in the 1890s. Two years later, he won praise in The New York Times from Clive Barnes, who, while savaging a modernistic interpretation of \u201cHamlet\u201d at the Public Theater in which Hamlet passed out peanuts and balloons to the audience, singled out Mr. Waite for his \u201cbluff, happy villainy\u201d as Claudius.\n\nMr. Waite began getting movie roles. He wrote a screenplay and showed it to the producer Lee Rich, who ran Lorimar Productions with Merv Adelson. Mr. Rich was not interested in the script, but asked Mr. Waite if he would be interested in playing the father of a Depression family in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mr. Waite became involved in politics and community work, leading an alcohol and drug recovery program, helping to build low-income housing and, in 1990, running for the House of Representatives. Despite contributions from Hollywood friends like Al Pacino, he lost to the Republican incumbent, Al McCandless.\n\nHe ran for Congress again in 1998, this time against Mary Bono, the widow of the pop singer and congressman Sonny Bono, who had been killed in a skiing accident. He lost to her both in a special election after Mr. Bono\u2019s death and in the subsequent general election.\n\nMr. Waite\u2019s campaign was handicapped by his commitment to appear as Willy Loman in Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d at a New Jersey theater, which forced him to commute back and forth to the West Coast.\n\nMr. Waite\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second, to Kerry Shear. He is survived by his wife, Linda East; a daughter, Kathleen; a stepson, Liam; and three grandchildren. A daughter, Suzanne, died several years ago.\n\nMr. Waite returned to the church in his later years, attending a liberal Presbyterian church in Palm Desert. He even preached a sermon or two, including one titled \u201cWe Are All Jews.\u201d\n\nAlways he was John Walton, the paternal voice of wisdom. He remembered a woman approaching him in a crowd and saying she had been poor as a child and had thought of him as her father. \u201cI went to school and college because of you,\u201d he recalled her saying.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Now I\u2019m a lawyer, and I don\u2019t think I would be if I hadn\u2019t seen that show,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Waite said. \u201cI\u2019m still amazed by that. It happens all the time.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this article had a number of errors. At his death, Mr. Waite lived in Palm Desert, Calif., not Palm Springs. The production of Jean Genet\u2019s \u201cThe Balcony\u201d in which he appeared as general understudy was Off-Broadway, not on Broadway. And he is survived by one daughter, not two. (One daughter had died.)\n\nA version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2014, on page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Ralph Waite, Patriarch in \u2018The Waltons,\u2019 Dies at 85.

The team called the injury a strained right trapezius and Anderson just spoke to reporters in the clubhouse, with a stim machine connected to his neck.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of a freak play,\u201d he said. \u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything major.\u201d\n\nWith Adam Eaton \u2013 who had singled to lead off, at first \u2013 Cliff Pennington put the ball in play. It got past Josh Donaldson, who was given an error. Anderson went over to cover third and had the ball and the runner both coming toward him at the same time.\n\n\u201cI got up and my neck just kind of balled up and spasmed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to be cautious. You don\u2019t want to overcompensate and change your mechanics, and hurt something else. It\u2019s just kind of a precautionary thing.\u201d\n\nAnderson joked that it was \u201cpure athleticism at its finest.\u201d He also said that of his eight pitches, he had one good changeup that Pennington fouled off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny scenario that he\u2019s the guy that hit the ball,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nAnderson was tagged for two runs, one earned, in the short outing. He was replaced by right-hander Mike Ekstrom.\n\n\u2013 Reliever Arnold Leon wasn\u2019t seen in the A\u2019s clubhouse before the game, though Bob Melvin expected Leon to return by Monday at the latest. Leon sparked the huge brawl in the Canada-Mexico World Baseball Classic game when he threw at a Canadian hitter after Canada\u2019s Chris Robinson had led off the inning with a bunt single, despite Canada\u2019s 9-3 lead.\n\nMelvin said he hadn\u2019t seen the benches-clearing fight and couldn\u2019t comment on the incident.\n\n\u201cI would have to see it to comment on it,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cWas it intentional?\u201d\n\nMelvin was assured by reporters that it certainly appeared intentional. Leon threw inside twice to Rene Tosoni, drawing a warning from home plate umpire Brian Gorman. On the next pitch, Leon hit Tosoni on the left shoulder. Television cameras had caught third baseman Luis Cruz apparently encouraging Leon to hit Tosoni.\n\nLeon was ejected from the game, along with three other Mexican players. Mexico was eliminated with the loss, making it a quick experience for Leon, who had only been called into the team last Thursday.\n\n\u2013 Melvin said that Yoenis Cespedes left for Miami on Saturday night and is expected back with the team either Monday or Tuesday. Cespedes went to greet his family members \u2013 14 in all, including his mother, aunts and cousins \u2013 who have been allowed to immigrate to the United States.\n\nMelvin thinks the development will be a huge relief for Cespedes.\n\n\u201cI know there were times last year where he was grinding on it pretty hard and for good reason,\u201d Melvin said. \u201dIt\u2019s a weight off his shoulders and something he doesn\u2019t have to think about, whereas last year he was constantly thinking about it.\u201d\n\nMelvin said Saturday was a very emotional day for Cespeds.\n\n\u201cTears and then big smiles,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Jemile Weeks was not in the lineup Sunday. Melvin described the second baseman as still day to day, with a bone bruise in his right shoulder.\n\n\u2013 Team chaplain Donnie Moore made his annual presentation in the A\u2019s clubhouse, where he combined motivational, positive messages with feats of strength. He and his partner tore phonebooks in half, broke bricks with their hands and rolled up a stainless steel frying pan like a burrito. They also broke baseball bats over their legs but that doesn\u2019t make them special: A\u2019s hitting coach Chili Davis used to do that all the time when he struck out.", "summary": "Brett Anderson Leaves Game After Just 8 Pitches", "density": 1.0, "coverage": 0.75, "compression": 94.75, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/20HARLEM.html", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160615010951id_/http://www.nytimes.com:80/2004/06/20/magazine/20HARLEM.html?", "title": "The New York Times", "date": "20160615010951", "text": "Canada admitted that he is engaged in a kind of triage. He described for me an imaginary Harlem parent. ''You can be 20 years old, with a job that doesn't pay you enough money to survive on,'' he said. ''You're underemployed. You've got a kid. The kid's not doing well in school. You've got no place for the kid to be after school. Well, we'll provide services for that child. But we're not going to solve the problem of you being underemployed. That's not going to go away.''\n\nHe is, in other words, sidestepping the macroeconomic solutions that some advocates insist are the only way to solve the problem of poverty -- better wages, a national jobs program, a bigger earned-income tax credit -- in favor of programs that in one way or another directly affect the performance of the neighborhood's poor children.\n\nCanada's educational philosophy emphasizes accountability and testing, and in that way it is similar to the dominant idea in public education today. The doctrine of accountability -- the idea that if students do poorly on standardized tests, schools should lose their financing and teachers should lose their jobs -- first emerged in the late 80's and early 90's in the Houston public schools. It then moved to the White House as the basis of the No Child Left Behind law when Rod Paige, the superintendent of the Houston schools, became the education secretary under George W. Bush. In the past year, though, news reports and lawsuits have revealed that when schools are compelled to meet certain numbers -- graduation rates, standardized-test scores -- their administrators often succumb to the urge to cheat. In Houston and New York, principals have shoved troubled students out of school, often under an administrative sleight of hand, in order to keep their schools' numbers artificially high. Canada has set the same rigorous goals for his own organization, but for him, the urge is the opposite: not to push the worst kids aside, but to recruit them even harder.\n\nOn this afternoon, Canada was worried about a set of internal statistics he had just uncovered: some of his students seemed to be doing too well. Last fall, his organization started a new program in four Harlem public schools called the Fifth Grade Institute, an after-school program for 160 fifth-grade students designed to begin catching them up to grade level before the charter school opens in September. Canada wanted to calculate how much the program was improving the reading ability of these students, so he asked to see their scores on the previous year's citywide fourth-grade reading test for comparison. Reading scores in New York City public schools are delivered in four categories, the higher the better. A 4 means the child is reading above grade level; a 3 means the child is reading at grade level; a 2 means below grade level; and a 1 means significantly below grade level. In most of the city, 2's and 3's predominate, with some 4's thrown in. In schools in Harlem, though, about three-quarters of the students score either a 1 or a 2; there are a few 3's, and 4's are rare.\n\nBut when Canada looked at the scores for the children in the Fifth Grade Institute, he found a lot of 3's -- more than a random sampling of Harlem students would have drawn. And on the day I visited, he was worried that the process of recruiting students for the Fifth Grade Institute had somehow been selective. He was sure it wasn't conscious on the part of his administrators, and, in fact, when he later received more detailed scores, they seemed more in line with the neighborhood patterns. Still, it was only natural, he knew, that parents who would bother to sign their children up for an ambitious after-school program would tend to be the better-organized, better-educated ones, and so it wouldn't be surprising if their children were better readers. Maybe his kids, the 1's and 2's, hadn't heard about the program, or maybe their parents hadn't managed to get it together in time to sign them up.\n\no what do you do? If you offer a new program, the best students will naturally enroll first, but you want the worst students. How do you get those parents to apply? Sometimes, in Canada's experience, it happens by accident. In 2001, the first year the Harlem Children's Zone offered Harlem Gems, its Head Start-like program for 4-year-olds, the organizers were behind schedule and didn't manage to send out fliers and start recruiting until August, just a few weeks before the program began. All the well-organized parents had already made their child-care plans for the year, and the last-minute, overburdened parents were the ones who signed up. That gave Canada the demographic he wanted, and he was able to get concrete results. When the 4-year-olds started Harlem Gems in 2001, 53 percent were scoring ''delayed'' or ''very delayed'' on the Bracken Basic Concept Scale for school readiness. At the end of the yearlong program, 26 percent were delayed.\n\nIn that case, the search for the most delayed kids worked because the organizers got lucky. Usually, though, it involves a lot of knocking on doors. I went out one morning with two outreach workers, Francesca Silfa and Mark Frazier, as they searched through central Harlem for new parents to enroll in Baby College. They knocked on the door of every apartment in a 21-story building on 118th Street, looking for parents with children under 4, leaving fliers under the doors if no one answered. They didn't meet with any resistance or hostility, although they did get a few skeptical looks. Mostly the process seemed slow and painstaking. Whenever they ran into Baby College graduates in the halls, they stopped to chat, prodding them for suggestions of good candidates in the building or elsewhere on the block. In addition to the door-to-door approach, recruiters visit laundromats, supermarkets and check-cashing outlets to look for new mothers. On the day I was with them, Silfa approached one woman pushing a stroller down 118th Street and managed to sign her and her daughter up on the spot.\n\nFor most parents, the attractions of a program like Baby College are obvious: useful information, the relief of spending Saturday morning getting to know other mothers instead of being stuck in a cramped apartment and free child care during class time. But if those aren't enough of a pull, there are raffles at the end of each class for $50 Old Navy gift certificates and a big drawing at the end of the course in which one parent wins a month's rent.\n\nThis combination of door-knocking, cajoling and offering incentives seems to work, and each nine-week session of Baby College draws a class of more than 100 parents, all of whom receive weekly follow-up visits at home. More than 95 percent of the parents -- 677 so far -- have successfully completed the course. The real test of this approach, Canada said when we spoke in February, will come when the Promise Academy opens its doors. By law, the charter school will be open to students from anywhere in the city's five boroughs, which means a lottery to choose the incoming classes from a broader pool of applicants. But the only students Canada really wants in his school are the ones from central Harlem, and especially the lowest-performing ones, exactly those whose parents, he said, are least inclined to apply to send their children to a special school.\n\n''I will make sure that every single poor-performing school and parent in Harlem knows about this program,'' Canada said back in February. ''And if we don't get more 1's and 2's than 3's, then we haven't done our job properly.'' What that will require, Canada said, is persistent recruiting. ''We're going to have to go and force some of these parents to come and fill out the application,'' he said. Even once he finds the 1's and 2's, he added, ''their parents may say no, which means we have to go back and figure out a way to bribe them and get them to say yes. And I hate to put it like that, but that's what we'll end up doing. We'll end up saying, 'If you get your kid to apply, you'll get free movie passes.'''\n\nThe point of all of this intensive recruiting is to amass evidence -- indisputable data that show exactly what it will take to level the playing field and get poor children performing on the same level as the city's middle-class children. ''If we just end up saving a bunch of kids in Harlem, that will be good for them, but it won't mean an awful lot to me in the long run,'' Canada said. ''We want to be able to say that thousands of poor children can learn at high levels and perform at rates that are the same as middle-class children if they are given the opportunity to do so. But I want to be clear when I say we've got an answer that we really have an answer.''\n\nThe answer that Canada wants to provide is in fact very much in demand. There are plenty of examples of programs that didn't work: in 2000, for example, the Heinz Endowments abandoned as a failure a $59 million, five-year program to provide early-childhood care and education for 7,600 low-income children in and around Pittsburgh. The program's costs soared, and four years in, when Heinz pulled the plug, only 680 children were being served. What is most startling about the current study of poverty is how little conclusive evidence there is about which cures do work. There are no more than a dozen studies in the field that track how successful various interventions are over the long term, and the evidence from those studies tends to be spotty and subject to debate.\n\nTo William Julius Wilson, the Harvard sociologist who is one of the country's leading thinkers on urban poverty, this is precisely the significance of the Harlem Children's Zone. ''It is very, very important for policy makers to be able to cite examples of how you can improve the life chances of disadvantaged kids,'' he said. ''There are so many people who feel that whatever you do, it's not going to work. They want to say, 'Well, there's just a culture of poverty out there, and you can't really change it.''' If Canada's project is successful, though, Wilson said, it will ''provide the ammunition to policy makers who want to do something to address the problems of poverty.'' It will allow them to say: ''Here are kids who would ordinarily end up as permanent economic proletarians, and here is a program that has been able to overcome the cumulative disadvantages of chronic subordination. So why not commit ourselves across the nation to try to duplicate what he's done?''\n\nCanada has a vivid picture in his mind of a judgment day to come -- 8, 10, 12 years down the road. Children who are now entering the system as infants will be taking their third-grade citywide math and reading tests, and they'll be scoring at or above grade level. Children who entered the system as Harlem Gems will be graduating from high school -- he expects that 90 percent of his students will graduate on time. It is only at that point, he explained, that he will be able to say to the rest of the country: ''This isn't an abstract conversation anymore. If you want poor children to do as well as middle-class children'' -- not necessarily to be superachievers but to become what he calls ''typical Americans,'' able to compete for jobs -- ''we now know how to do it.'' If he's right, the services he will provide will cost about $1,400 a year per student, on top of existing public-school funds. The country will finally know, he said, what the real price tag is for poor children to succeed.\n\nCanada first came up with the idea for the Harlem Children's Zone in the mid-90's, but it wasn't until a few years later that he was ready to propose it officially to the board of the Rheedlen Centers (as the organization was then known). Crime had dropped sharply in Harlem, as it had everywhere in New York City, and Canada was no longer overwhelmed by the daily anxiety of trying to prevent the children in his programs from being killed. The national economy was booming, housing prices in the neighborhood were climbing and the first signs of gentrification were appearing, but for children in Harlem, the situation hadn't improved much. The unemployment rate there was still very high. (Even now, after the arrival of new middle-class residents, it stands at 18.5 percent.) It was in this context that Canada went before the Rheedlen board in 1998 and said that he wanted to remake the organization completely, to set up a kind of project that had never been tried before.\n\nCanada had recently brought on a new board member, a fellow Bowdoin alumnus named Stan Druckenmiller, who, while running George Soros's Quantum Fund, became one of the most successful hedge-fund managers in the history of the stock market, amassing a personal fortune estimated at more than $1 billion. After Canada laid out his proposal to the board, Druckenmiller took him aside and told him that in his opinion he had the right plan but the wrong board. Canada agreed, and the two men politely deposed the chairman and replaced him with Druckenmiller, who set about raising money and recruiting new board members from the higher echelons of Wall Street.\n\nThe organization now has a lot more money than it did a few years ago. Druckenmiller paid for about a third of the cost of the new headquarters himself, and board members contribute about a third of the annual operating budget. (The rest comes from foundations, the government and private donors.) In April, the organization held a glittering fund-raising dinner at Cipriani 42nd Street, a cavernous former bank building converted into a restaurant, and raised $2.8 million in a single night, mostly from bankers and stockbrokers. (The 2003 fund-raiser, by comparison, pulled in $1.5 million.)\n\nFinanciers and C.E.O.'s are drawn to the Harlem Children's Zone not just because of its mission but also because of the way it is run. In fact, the relationship the organization has with its donors is as unusual, arguably, as the program itself. In the late 90's, Allen Grossman, then the president of Outward Bound U.S.A. and now a management professor at the Harvard Business School, began studying the nonprofit sector from a business perspective. It was a mess, he concluded: in an article in The Harvard Business Review in 1997, he described a hopelessly dysfunctional relationship between foundations and nonprofit organizations, in which foundations made short-term grants to pet projects, nonprofits spent all their time chasing money and each side had a vested interest in maintaining the reassuring fiction that failing programs were actually succeeding. Grossman proposed that philanthropists start thinking more like venture capitalists: searching out nonprofits with innovative long-term ideas, financing them early, insisting on transparency and frequent evaluation and nurturing them along the way with expert advice and continuing infusions of capital.\n\nOne of the first foundations to take Grossman's ideas seriously was the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, which had been financing Rheedlen for years. In 1999, Nancy Roob, the foundation's grant manager, approached Canada and offered him $250,000, plus the dedicated services of a new management consultancy for nonprofits called the Bridgespan Group, to write a new business plan. This was unheard of: when philanthropists give away a quarter of a million dollars, they generally want the money to go directly to poor people, with as little overhead as possible. Clark, by contrast, was inviting Canada to spend the foundation's money -- first the $250,000, and eventually another $1 million -- entirely on overhead: on developing the business plan; creating a new, more hierarchical management structure; buying new technology for an internal communication system; and constructing a rigorous and continuing process of self-evaluation.\n\nThe business plan that Canada's team came up with proposed a steady increase in the annual budget over nine years, from $6 million to $10 million to $46 million. (This year, four years in, it is $24 million.) The plan reads more like a corporate strategy document than a charity prospectus. It refers to ''market-penetration targets'' and ''new information technology applications,'' including a ''performance-tracking system.'' In practice, too, the organization feels more like a business than a nonprofit, which offers comforting visuals to donors: everyone at the headquarters wears a suit, every meeting starts on time and there is a constant flow of evaluations, reports and budgets. ''Geoff could be a C.E.O. at any S.&P. 500 company,'' Druckenmiller said, and he meant it as a compliment.\n\nuring the months I spent visiting Canada, the issue of education took up more and more of his time and attention. When we first spoke, almost a year ago, he described all of the organization's programs -- an initiative to combat asthma, an organizing campaign for tenants -- as equally important. But as the months wore on, it seemed, all he could think about were the problems in the schools. He was pouring more and more resources into Harlem's public schools, paying for in-class tutors and after-school reading programs, and scores had barely budged. He was beginning to see it as a systemic problem, he said, something that couldn't be solved by the kind of supplementary services he was offering. ''We've got to really do something radically different if we're going to save these kids,'' he told me in the fall. ''If we keep fooling around on the fringes, I know 10 years will go by, and instead of 75 percent of the kids in Harlem scoring below grade level on their reading scores, maybe it will be 70 percent, or maybe it will be 65 percent. People will say, 'Oh, we're making progress.' But that to me is not progress. This is much more urgent than that.''\n\nSo at the same time that he has been working inside the school system with a greater intensity than before, he has also begun to try to opt out of it, by establishing charter schools. Beginning in September, the Harlem Children's Zone plans to start educating its own students at two locations. The Promise Academy, which will eventually be a kindergarten-through-12th-grade charter school, will start with a kindergarten and sixth-grade class in September. The sixth grade will be housed in the organization's new headquarters on 125th Street; the kindergarten is expected to open inside an existing public school. The academy will expand over the course of seven years into a school of 1,300 students. The curriculum will be intense: classes will run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., five days a week -- an hour and a half longer than regular city schools. After-school programs will run until 6 p.m., and the school year will continue well into July.\n\nAlthough charter schools are regulated by the state, and are outside the city's control, Joel I. Klein, the city's schools chancellor, has supported Canada's charter-school efforts. Canada said he sees Bloomberg and Klein as his allies, which is a strange feeling, he said, because for so long he felt as if he were at war with the school system. Soon after Klein was appointed, in the fall of 2002, he called Canada and set up a meeting. Canada said that the proposals Klein laid out for the entire school system -- greater accountability, more charter schools, more involvement for outside groups -- were exactly what Canada had been waiting to hear. In the summer of 2003, Klein appointed Lucille Swarns to be the regional superintendent for Upper Manhattan, and when Canada met her, he was once again pleasantly surprised.\n\n''When I first came here in the early 1980's,'' Canada said, ''we felt that District 3'' -- which stretches from the Upper West Side into central Harlem -- ''ran a system almost of apartheid, where below 96th Street, the schools were doing great, and the schools we cared about were doing lousy.'' Even after his organization began spending a million dollars a year in the district's schools, he said, he never once got a call from the district superintendent. With Swarns things were different right away.\n\nThe most surprising aspect of the new collaboration between Klein and Canada is that the chancellor is encouraging the Harlem Children's Zone's plans to convert existing public schools in Harlem into charter schools. Canada has received conditional approval from Klein to start a slowly expanding charter school, beginning this fall with the Promise Academy's kindergarten class. As those children move through the school, the organization will take over control of an additional grade each year, sharing the building with the public school while gradually supplanting it. In six years, Canada explained, ''we're going to put the existing school out of business'' -- and he said he hopes that that school is only the beginning.\n\nAll of which makes skeptics, especially those in the teachers' union, wonder about Canada's motivation. Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said that she used to be friendly with Canada, even attending his fund-raisers, until Bloomberg and Klein came into office and started making threatening noises toward her union. ''Since the mayor became mayor, Geoff Canada has stopped having any relationship with us,'' she said.\n\nIn her opinion, Canada's new attitude comes down to politics: ''I think what's happened is that they've decided that they'll work with the mayor, and that they won't work with the public-school system except through the mayor and the chancellor'' -- meaning that they won't work with the teachers' union. Canada often speaks of the opposition that his charter-school plan is going to face from the teachers' union and what he calls the educational establishment, but to Weingarten, it's the other way around: it's Canada who is picking this fight, demonizing the teachers' union in order to score political points with the mayor. ''They are working very secretly with the Board of Education and the Bloomberg administration'' on the charter-school plan, she said, a strategy that she said was shortsighted, not least because it is far from certain that Bloomberg will be re-elected. ''If you truly want schools to succeed,'' she said, ''you work with the people who represent the teachers.''\n\nThe battle between the teachers' union and City Hall has been going on for decades, but it has reached an unusually high pitch under Bloomberg. Canada clearly feels a genuine ideological kinship with the mayor, and with Klein, but there's also an immediate advantage to his alliance with them: his charter schools will use nonunion teachers; they will be paid more than public-school teachers, he said, but they will also work longer days, and for 12 months a year. Canada also wanted a free hand to fire teachers who weren't performing up to his expectations -- authority Canada said he felt sure the union would not give him. At his new school, he will have it.\n\nn the days and weeks leading up to the charter-school lottery, the organization's outreach workers did exactly what Geoffrey Canada said they would do: they went door-to-door in housing projects, they tracked down recalcitrant mothers and fathers, they solicited applications from the parents of children in every one of their programs. And by the evening of the lottery, a rainy Tuesday in April, they had received 359 applications for just 180 slots -- 90 in the kindergarten class and 90 in the sixth grade. Legally, they could have held the lottery behind closed doors and simply mailed out acceptance letters, but Canada wanted it to be a real event, so he arranged to hold the lottery in public, in the auditorium of P.S. 242 on West 122nd Street.\n\nBy the time the lottery began, the place was packed. Every seat was filled with a hopeful parent or a prospective student or a patient sibling, and late arrivals were standing in the aisles or cramming themselves into the back of the room. Multicolored helium balloons were tied to the end of each row of seats, which gave the room a festive air, but more than anything the place felt nervous.\n\nCanada took the stage. On a long table next to him, a gold drum held a jumble of index cards, each one printed with the name of a child. ''We are calling our school Promise Academy because we are making a promise to all of our parents,'' Canada said from behind a lectern. ''If your child is in our school, we will guarantee that child succeeds. There will be no excuses. We're not going to say, 'The child failed because they came from a home with only one parent.' We're not going to say, 'The child failed because they're new immigrants into the country.' If your child gets into our school, that child is going to succeed. If you work with us as parents, we are going to do everything -- and I mean everything -- to see that your child gets a good education.''\n\nAnd then the drawing began, starting with the kindergarten class. Doreen Land, the charter schools' newly hired superintendent, read the first name into a microphone: ''Dijon Brinnard.'' A whoop went up from the back of the auditorium, and a jubilant mother started edging her way out of her row, proudly clutching the hand of her 4-year-old son. Land smiled and took the next card: ''Kasim-Seann Cisse.'' Another whoop, some applause and then another name.\n\nAt the front of the auditorium, Canada greeted each mother (or, occasionally, father) and child. Proud parents shook his hand and introduced their children, beaming on their way back to their seats. In the second row, a woman in her 40's, wearing an ''I Love New York'' T-shirt and a red nylon jacket, sat with her head bowed and her eyes shut tight, her lips moving in an anxious prayer. And then Land called the name ''Jaylene Fonseca,'' and the woman's eyes flew open. She made her way to the front, shook Canada's hand and then told me that her name was Wilma Jure and that Jaylene was her niece, a 4-year-old already enrolled in Harlem Gems. As her eyes filled with tears, she explained that Jaylene's mother, Jure's sister, was living in the city's shelter system for homeless families. Most nights, Jaylene slept with her mother in a shelter on 41st Street, then spent the day in Harlem Gems. ''It's an amazing program for people like us who really don't have the means to send our kids to get such a good education,'' Jure said. ''I mean, she's learning French,'' she added, a little incredulous. Now Jaylene was guaranteed a spot in the Promise Academy from kindergarten through the end of high school. It was hard not to feel that her life had just changed for the better, with the draw of a card.\n\nAs the evening wore on, though, the mood in the auditorium started to shift. The kindergarten lottery ended, the chosen students trooped out to the cafeteria for a group photo and the sixth-grade lottery began. In the front row, Virainia Utley sat with her daughter Janiqua, listening to the names being called. Utley is something of a model parent in the Harlem Children's Zone. Janiqua is in the Fifth Grade Institute at P.S. 242, and her three younger siblings -- Jaquan, Janisha and John -- are all enrolled in the computer-assisted after-school reading program. Utley is the vice president of her tenants' association, which was organized by Community Pride, the community-organizing division, and she is a regular presence at Zone events. When I first met her, months earlier, she was already talking about Janiqua going to the Promise Academy. But now the lottery numbers were rising -- 54, 55, 56 -- and her name hadn't yet been called.\n\nAfter Land read out the 90th name, Canada took the stage again and explained to the remaining parents that it wasn't likely that there would be room for their children in the sixth grade. Land would read out the rest of the names and put them on a waiting list, he said, but this part wouldn't be much fun. He encouraged everyone to go home. Land went back to reading names, and Utley and Janiqua sat and listened, still in their seats, as the waiting list grew and the number of cards in the drum dwindled. By the time Land got to the 80th place on the waiting list, Utley told me, she and Janiqua were just waiting to make sure her name was called. Maybe her card got lost, she said, or stuck to another card. The room was thinning out, and the only remaining parents were angry ones. One by one they were letting Canada know how they felt. A line of parents came up to him to find out what could be done to get their children into the school, and he had to tell each one the same thing: nothing could be done. One woman, who was too angry to give me her name, spat out her complaint. ''It's not fair,'' she shouted. ''And I don't like it.'' Why drag everyone out on a rainy night, she wanted to know, just to sit in a public-school auditorium and feel like losers?\n\nFinally, at No. 111 on the waiting list, Janiqua Utley's name was called, and her mother rose, took her by the hand and started up the aisle to the backdoor. As workers began sweeping up coffee cups and popped balloons, I sat down next to Canada. He looked exhausted, overwhelmed not only by the evening but also by the enormity of the task ahead of him. His eyes were watery, and as we talked, he dabbed periodically at his nose with his folded-up handkerchief. ''I was trying to get folks to leave and not to hang around to be the last kid called,'' he said. ''This is very hard for me to see. It's very, very sad. These parents feel, Well, there go my child's chances.''\n\nIt was a waiting list, I reminded him, that had started him on the path toward the Harlem Children's Zone more than a decade ago -- and now, despite all the millions of dollars, and the staff of 650 and the backing of the mayor, he is still setting up waiting lists. He nodded. ''We've got to do more,'' he said. ''We've got to do better.'' He sighed and looked up at the stage, where Land had just reached No. 150.\n\nPaul Tough is an editor at The New York Times Magazine.", "summary": "Geoffrey Canada has a radical new thesis: If you really want to change the lives of inner-city kids, change everything all at once.", "density": 1.2142857143, "coverage": 0.8571428571, "compression": 222.4642857143, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}, {"url": "http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/02/16/obama-aide-podesta-regrets-not-disclosing-ufo-files/", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2015021619id_/http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/02/16/obama-aide-podesta-regrets-not-disclosing-ufo-files/", "title": "Former Obama aide Podesta regrets not disclosing UFO files", "date": "2015021619", "text": "U.S. President Barack Obama walks on the Ellipse with White House counselor John Podesta near the White House in Washington May 21, 2014.

Back in 2002 Podesta even discussed the importance of disclosing government UFO records at a conference organized by the Coalition for Freedom of Information. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to open the book on questions that have remained in the dark, on the question of government investigations of UFOs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ought to do it, really, because it\u2019s right, we ought to do it because the American people, quite frankly, can handle the truth, and we ought to do it because it\u2019s a law.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Podesta wrote the foreword to Leslie Kean\u2019s 2010 book \u201cUFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record.\u201d\n\nThe public\u2019s appetite for information on UFOs remains strong.

Greenwald had spent decades filing Freedom of Information Act requests on the topic.\n\nHowever, scant reference is made to Roswell, New Mexico, in the database.

(NASA)\n\nHumanity is on the verge of discovering alien life, high-ranking NASA scientists say.\n\n\"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,\" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday (April 7) during a panel discussion that focused on the space agency's efforts to search for habitable worlds and alien life.\n\n\"We know where to look. We know how to look,\" Stofan added during the event, which was webcast live. \"In most cases we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road.\" [5 Bold Claims of Alien Life]\n\nFormer astronaut John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, shared Stofan's optimism, predicting that signs of life will be found relatively soon both in our own solar system and beyond.\n\n\"I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation [away] on a planet around a nearby star,\" Grunsfeld said during Tuesday's event.\n\nRecent discoveries suggest that the solar system and broader Milky Way galaxy teem with environments that could support life as we know it, Grunsfeld said.\n\nFor example, oceans of liquid water slosh beneath the icy shells of the Jupiter moons Europa and Ganymede, as well as that of the Saturn satellite Enceladus. Oceans covered much of Mars in the ancient past, and seasonal dark streaks observed on the Red Planet's surface today may be caused by salty flowing water.\n\nFurther, NASA's Curiosity rover has found carbon-containing organic molecules and \"fixed\" nitrogen, basic ingredients necessary for Earth-like life, on the Martian surface.\n\nFarther afield, observations by NASA's Kepler space telescope suggest that nearly every star in the sky hosts planets \u2014 and many of these worlds may be habitable. Indeed, Kepler's work has shown that rocky worlds like Earth and Mars are probably more common throughout the galaxy than gas giants such as Saturn and Jupiter.\n\nAnd just as the solar system is awash in water, so is the greater galaxy, said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's Astrophysics Division.\n\nThe Milky Way is \"a soggy place,\" Hertz said during Tuesday's event. \"We can see water in the interstellar clouds from which planetary systems and stellar systems form. We can see water in the disks of debris that are going to become planetary systems around other stars, and we can even see comets being dissipated in other solar systems as [their] star evaporates them.\" [6 Most Likely Places for Alien Life in the Solar System]\n\nHunting for evidence of alien life is a much trickier proposition than identifying potentially habitable environments. But researchers are working steadily toward that more involved and ambitious goal, Stofan and others said.\n\nFor example, the agency's next Mars rover, scheduled to launch in 2020, will search for signs of past life and cache samples for a possible return to Earth for analysis. NASA also aims to land astronauts on Mars in the 2030s \u2014 a step Stofan regards as key to the search for Mars life.\n\n\"I'm a field geologist; I go out and break open rocks and look for fossils,\" Stofan said. \"Those are hard to find. So I have a bias that it's eventually going to take humans on the surface of Mars \u2014 field geologists, astrobiologists, chemists \u2014 actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to Earth for all the scientists to argue about.\"\n\nNASA is also planning out a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022. The main goal of this $2.1 billion mission will be to shed light on the icy moon's potential habitability, but it could also search for signs of alien life: Agency officials are considering ways to sample and study the plumes of water vapor that apparently erupt from Europa's south polar region.\n\nIn the exoplanet realm, the agency's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), an $8.8 billion instrument scheduled to launch in 2018, will scope out the atmospheres of nearby \"super-Earth\" alien planets, looking for gases that may have been produced by life.\n\nJWST will scan the starlight that passes through the air of super-Earths, which are more massive than our own planet but significantly less so than gaseous worlds such as Uranus and Neptune. This method, called transit spectroscopy, will likely not work for potentially habitable Earth-size worlds, Hertz said.\n\nSearching for biosignature gases on small, rocky exoplanets will instead probably require direct imaging of these worlds, using a \"coronagraph\" to block out the overwhelming glare of their parent stars, Hertz added.\n\nNASA's potential Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, which may launch in the mid-2020s if given the official go-ahead, would include a coronagraph for exoplanet observations.", "summary": "Humanity is on the verge of discovering alien life, high-ranking NASA scientists say.", "density": 17.0, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 59.6470588235, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://time.com/money/3117377/google-10-ways-changed-world/", "archive": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160723225633id_/http://time.com:80/money/3117377/google-10-ways-changed-world/", "title": "Here Are 10 Ways It's Changed the World", "date": "20160723225633", "text": "Back in 2004, investors weren\u2019t entirely sure what to make of Google, and skeptics abounded. Fast-forward to today, when we can look back at how far the company has come, in ways that inspire both awe and concern. Below are 10 examples of its influence.\n\n1. It has changed our language. Despite Microsoft\u2019s best efforts, there\u2019s a reason \u201cBing\u201d never caught on as a verb, let alone as a beleaguered anthropomorphic meme. The phrase \u201cto Google\u201d is so popular that the company is actually worried about losing trademark rights if the term becomes generic, like \u201cescalator\u201d and \u201czipper,\u201d which were once trademarked.\n\n2. It has changed our brains. Recent research has confirmed suspicions that 24/7 access to (near) limitless information is not only bad for human discourse\u2014it\u2019s also making us worse at remembering things, regardless of whether we try. And even if we aren\u2019t conscious of it, our brains are primed to think about the Internet as soon as we start trying to recall the answer to a tough trivia question. Essentially, Google has become our collective mental crutch.\n\n3. It set the stage for Facebook and Twitter\u2019s sky-high valuations. Yes, lofty valuations based on mere speculation were also common back in the dot-com fervor of the \u201990s, says Ed Crotty, chief investment officer for Davidson Investment Advisors. But Google broke new ground by proving that even just the potential for a huge audience could pay off in a big way.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people were thinking in terms of web portals, the barriers to entry didn\u2019t seem high for search,\u201d Crotty says. That meant Google\u2019s competitive advantage wasn\u2019t clear. But \u201cthe tipping point was when Google was able to scale up their audience enough to attract ad agencies, and then further improve their algorithms, since those get better with scale. That\u2019s partly why you see tech companies now willing to forgo profits for a period of time in order to build an audience.\u201d And also why investors are willing to throw money their way.\n\n4. It has taken over our cell phones. Since the first Android phone was sold in 2008, Google\u2019s mobile operating system has bulldozed the competition. Today it claims nearly 85% of market share, nearly doubling its hold over the last three years. Next stop, self-driving cars?\n\n5. It has transformed the way we use e-mail. Gmail was invented a decade ago, before bottomless inboxes were a sine qua non. It\u2019s hard even to remember those dark ages when storage space was sacred\u2014and deleting emails was as tedious-but-necessary as flossing. Today our accounts serve as mausoleums, housing long-forgotten files, links, and even whole relationships. Google itself has touted alternative uses for Gmail, such as setting up a virtual time capsule for your newborn\u2014though in practice accounts can\u2019t be owned by anyone under 13. But even that last point is about to change.\n\n6. It\u2019s changed how we collaborate. Back in 2006, Google acquired the company behind an online word processor named Writely. With that bet, Google created a world where it\u2019s taken for granted that people can collaborate on virtually any type of document, whether for work, play, or (literally) revolution.\n\n7. It has allowed us to travel the globe from our desks. Yes, MapQuest was popular first. But Google Maps (and Earth) has become much more than a tool for measuring travel routes and times. Since Google Street View came onto the scene in 2007, it\u2019s been possible to \u201cvisit\u201d distant destinations, give friends a virtual tour of your hometown, plan ahead of trips, and waste even more time on the Internet. Of course, the more popular a tool, the more useful it is to those who\u2019d like to spy on us.\n\n8. It has influenced the news we read. Ranking high in Google search results is serious business and can have a profound effect on the success of companies, media outlets, and even politicians. When I just Googled \u201chow SEO affects journalism,\u201d this link was at the top of my search results. How is that significant? Well, for one, that story itself has been so successfully search engine optimized that it still tops the list despite being four years old.\n\nBut most importantly, many of the concerns raised in the piece have not gone away\u2014such as the pressure to \u201cfile some pithy blog post about the hot topic of the moment\u201d at the expense of covering stories that would be prioritized based on traditional measures of newsworthiness. What that means for you, the reader: more headlines like this and this.\n\n9. It has turned users into commodities. We all love free stuff, but it\u2019s easy to forget that services offered by companies like Google and Facebook aren\u2019t truly \u201cfree,\u201d as data expert Bruce Schneier has pointed out. Remember that all of your data (across ALL of the services you use, and that includes Calendar, Maps, and so on) is a valuable good that Google is packaging and selling to its real customers\u2014advertisers.\n\n10. It\u2019s changed how everyone else sees YOU. Unlike your Facebook profile, the links that turn up when potential employers (or love interests) Google you can be near-impossible to erase. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Google uses the fear of embarrassing search results to encourage people to manage their image through Google+ profiles.\n\nRelated: 4 Crazy Google Ambitions The 8 Worst Predictions About Google", "summary": "It's been a decade since Google went public.

The attacks by Republicans on the industry rankle, not only because the party generally embraces business, but because some of the group\u2019s key members, including buyout giants Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., have been donors to Gingrich over the years.\n\nIn this election cycle, Gingrich\u2019s 12th-largest source of funds is Blackstone Group, the New York investment firm. Employees there have donated $7,000 to his presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn 1996, when Gingrich was speaker of the House, he received $5,000 from private equity executives - notably Henry Kravis of KKR and John Childs, then of Thomas H. Lee Partners in Boston, according to an analysis by MapLight, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics.\n\nGingrich, despite his comments about Romney\u2019s work, also served on the advisory board of a private equity firm, Forstmann Little & Co., after leaving Congress in 1999, Fortune and The New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cIt is not the industry in question, it is the decisions Mitt Romney made when he was at the helm at Bain,\u2019\u2019 said Gingrich campaign spokesman R.C. Hammond.\n\nKen Spain, a spokesman for the Private Equity council, said in a statement that it is no surprise Romney\u2019s record is being scrutinized. But, he said, the council aims to show people \u201chow private equity grows and saves businesses.\u2019\u2019 Going forward, he said, \u201cwe plan to aggressively defend the industry against any mischaracterizations, regardless of political affiliation.\u2019\u2019\n\nRomney\u2019s position on the campaign trail has been that buyouts often involve troubled companies, and that job cuts are sometimes necessary to repair a business so it can grow again. But critics point to deals where Bain and Romney made profits even when the companies went bankrupt and jobs were lost.\n\nBain partners - many of them friends with the man who started the firm in 1984 - would prefer to quietly run billions of dollars in private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds, without the national spotlight shining so unflatteringly on them.\n\nTo some extent, the Bain Capital partners are hardened to the scrutiny after prior encounters with the rough-and-tumble political world. They were truly jarred in 1994, when Romney ran against Edward M. Kennedy for US Senate, and Kennedy unleashed an attack on him for layoffs at an Indiana paper company called Ampad.\n\nLater, there was Romney\u2019s successful run for governor of Massachusetts and unsuccessful first run for president.\n\nThe Ampad deal and others have been detailed many times, excruciatingly for the Bain Capital partners, who say they have created many more jobs than they have lost. Romney\u2019s partners are not arguing with the revised number of jobs he now says he helped to create - 100,000 versus the tens of thousands he used to cite. But they would not back up the number or account for it in detail.\n\nLandry, of TA Associates, said private equity has helped the companies his firm has invested in.

Based on the height and weight information presented, survey staffers calculated each respondent's BMI, or body-mass index, a tool commonly (though not necessarily appropriately, according to this) used to assess weight.\n\nHere were the key findings, as reported by Harris International:\n\nHow would you have fared on the survey?

Beware bed bug remedies Next: Speak up for better nutrition\n\nThe first set of findings, which are essentially based on our own misperceptions of ourselves, is not surprising. When the majority of people are overweight, the new \"norm\" begins to be overweight. Thus, people use that, without realizing it, as their yardstick for judging themselves. Men are constantly being told that being skinny is un-masculine, thus leading to this desire to be a bit \"beefier\", which usually ends up meaning overweight.\n\nWomen, on the other hand, are getting feedback that all those \"skinny\" women are actually underweight when, in reality, most of those women's weights are perfectly normal (I'm not saying that some of these skinny women aren't getting there through poor eating habits or even eating disorders -- just simply that their weights are normal).\n\nAnyway, when we judge ourselves, we almost always imagine we're not too far off from average. If the average is overweight, though, that means when we walk down the street, the majority of people we're looking at are overweight -- not something most of want to think about.\n\nI should also note that women face another problem. Because BMI is affected by the square of one's height, 10 extra lbs on a 5'8\" person is quite different from 10 extra lbs on a 5'2\" person. Obviously, women are, on average, shorter than men. So, a few extra pounds on a woman can mean a lot more than on a man in terms of BMI.\n\nWe need to understand that human beings evolved to be, and should be, rather lithe creatures. Homo sapiens out-competed our \"bigger-boned\" cousins such as Neanderthals.\n\nPosted by: rlalumiere | September 6, 2010 12:49 PM | Report abuse\n\nI'm sorry, but the BMI scale is a useless tool for gauging obesity or over-weightedness.

The quarterly loss \u2014 down from a profit of 316.8 billion yen a year ago \u2014 was bigger than the full-year loss because it had some positive quarters earlier in the fiscal year.\n\nThroughout much of last year, Toyota sales were booming, thanks to its reputation for quality and good mileage, and the popularity of its Camry sedan and Prius hybrid.\n\nIt even overtook GM last year to become the world's biggest automaker by annual sales.\n\nBut Toyota's business has been hit hard by the U.S. financial crisis and credit crunch, which sent ripple effects around the world, causing people to hold off on buying new cars. The red ink for the full year was worse than Toyota's own forecast for a 350 billion yen net loss, and a stunning reversal from the record profit of 1.72 trillion yen it chalked up the previous fiscal year.\n\nSales for the fiscal year sank 21.9% to 20.529 trillion yen. In the year ahead, Toyota reckons it will sell about 1 million fewer vehicles, with revenue sliding 19.6% to 16.5 trillion yen.\n\nToyota's quarterly loss eclipsed GM's $6 billion in red ink for the same quarter \u2014 although the Japanese manufacturer is on far stronger capital footing than GM because of its historical profits. For all 2008, GM lost $30.9 billion.\n\nRobert Wiseman, professor of business at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said Toyota should emerge in good shape in the long run, and can even hope to benefit from a decrease in price competition in the U.S. as rivals weaken.\n\n\"Toyota continues to have a very strong positive brand reputation among North American buyers,\" he said. \"I would expect all global car manufactures to report a loss this fiscal year since car sales are way down.\"\n\nStandard and Poor's on Friday lowered its long-term credit rating on Toyota one notch to AA \u2014 its third-highest rating \u2014 and gave a \"negative\" outlook. But S&P also said the automaker \"maintains a minimal financial risk profile, characterized by a strong capital structure with massive liquidity.\"\n\nToyota is likely to face hard times for awhile because demand will likely remain depressed into 2010 before it could hope to again count on its strengths to boost profits once a recovery arrives, S&P said in a statement.\n\nA turnaround is likely to take time.\n\nTo cut costs, Toyota has been slashing managerial pay and offering buyouts to thousands of American workers. It has reduced the number of temporary workers in Japan from 9,200 last year to 3,000.\n\nThe manufacturer is expecting its operating loss \u2014 reflecting its core automaking business \u2014 to worsen to 850 billion yen for the year through March 2010 from 461 billion yen this past year.\n\n\"It appears to take some more time before the financial markets in the U.S. and Europe normalize and the global economy recovers,\" Watanabe said.\n\nToyota's vehicle sales for the fiscal year ended March 31 fell 15.1% to 7.57 million vehicles from 8.91 million the previous year. It expects to sell even fewer vehicles in the fiscal year through March 2010 \u2014 6.5 million vehicles.\n\nWiseman, the MSU professor, says Toyota should prepare for a recovery.\n\n\"What Toyota can do as it waits for the economy to turn around is invest in the next generation of vehicles and work on improving quality control,\" he said.\n\nTo send a message of change, Toyota has turned to its founding family roots, tapping Akio Toyoda, the founder's grandson, who at 53 is relatively young for leading a major Japanese company.\n\nWatanabe, whom Toyoda is succeeding in June, promised Friday more cost reduction and a focus on hybrids and compact vehicles to boost profitability.\n\nThe last time Toyota had the equivalent of a net loss was in 1950, when it reported results under different accounting standards than it uses now.\n\nToyota is unveiling the remodeled, third-generation Prius hybrid later this month. But it is expected to be embroiled in intense competition with Japanese rival Honda, which has already come out with a cheaper hybrid, the Insight.\n\nYasuaki Iwamoto, auto analyst with Okasan Securities Co., said Toyota must wait for overall industry woes to settle, but also must work on cut costs and develop cheap small cars.\n\n\"It must keep working on small cars to build toward the future,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2009 The Associated Press.

This week, the bigger news was the swing vote cast by Justice Roberts, and why he did it. Did the liberal media sway his vote?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: A lot of folks lost their jobs, and a lot of folks retrained and are back.\n\nSCOTT: Mr. Obama hits the road in his Canadian-made tour buses, pushing his plan for America, and doing all he can to put his rival, Mitt Romney, in a negative light. Are the liberal media helping him do just that?\n\nGOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.: Are you stupid?\n\nSCOTT: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie showing no love to a reporter asking the wrong questions.

It turns out the ruling almost went the other way.\n\nJAN CRAWFORD, CBS NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Scott, it was a shift that no one would have expected. Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to lead this court in a more conservative direction, initially, was poised to strike down the key part of the health care law. But then, he changed his mind and the outcome of this entire case.\n\nSCOTT: CBS News, and its legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, breaking the story earlier this week that Chief Justice John Roberts originally decided with conservatives about the Obama-care mandate. And while writing the decision, changed his mind. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nJim, the question is, how did CBS get that info and was it news for coverage of the court going forward?\n\nJIM PINKERTON, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE MAGAZINE: Jan is a very good reporter, so we assume that she got it from another justice. She had a lot of detail about Anthony Kennedy, you know, apparently spending a month trying to get Roberts on this decision. It opens up a whole new place for leaks and -- to come from and information that wants to be free, including the court now.\n\nSCOTT: It does seem strange. Judy, the Supreme Court has been sort of a bastion of secrecy up until now.\n\nJUDY MILLER, WRITER & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It has been. And you could see up that in reporting in the lead up to this decision, where just about everybody, including Jeffrey Toobin, who is much respected and admired, got it wrong. That actually speaks well for the court. It's one of the few places where you can keep a secret, or at least, Jim, could keep a secret, until this reporter, this very enterprising and excellent Jan Crawford reporter, gave us some genuine news and insight into the court.\n\nSCOTT: Alan, I'm certain that, as the liberal, you are pleased with the ruling.\n\nALAN COLMES, HOST, \"THE ALAN COLMES SHOW\": You don't need me here. You know what I'll say.\n\nSCOTT: What about the fact -- I mean, didn't the coverage persuade the chief justice to change his mind? And, if so --\n\nCOLMES: -- the line. He must have done it because he wanted to please the liberal media or please the White House or please the establishment. If he did change his mind at the last minute, much like -- and Justice Kennedy did in the Casey versus Pennsylvania (ph) abortion ruling a number of years ago, 1992, we don't know why he did it. Until he decides to speak up about it, we're not going to know. But the right wing media has decided it must have been a nefarious reason that --\n\nSCOTT: Well, but, Cal, there were a bunch of articles -- there were a bunch of articles warning about the damage to the court if this became another 5-4 decision with Roberts in the majority.\n\nCAL THOMAS, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Certain people calculated, base on John Roberts' background, and his adhering to the Constitution, an image of the court that he could be persuaded. That's why you have Patrick Leahy, Senator from Vermont, making an unprecedented speech on the Senate floor about what the court ought to do. This was a major campaign. the most interesting, I though, insight into this, came from Paul Rothstein, professor of law and John Roberts' teacher at Georgetown University Law School, who got on WTOP Radio in Washington and talked about everything influencing Roberts except the Constitution. He wanted to seem to be fair. He didn't want being characterized as being uncaring or unresponsive to people without health care. He had good health care. He was in business for a while. I mean, it had nothing to do with the Constitution --\n\nCOLMES: -- we're impugning his integrity. Yet, the media did little coverage of -- for example, only the L.A. Times covered the two justices, Scalia and Thomas, were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that argued against the health care law. The media hardly ever covered that.

At least three dozen levees, berms and other flood barriers have been overtopped along the Mississippi in the last two weeks as the runoff from torrential rains this month pushed south along the main U.S. inland waterway.\n\nSeveral flood warnings remained in effect for communities in Missouri and Illinois, but officials said they expected the worst was over, with the focus now shifting to clean-up.\n\n\"We're just mentally and physically exhausted,\" said Winfield, Missouri, resident Carol Broseman, who fled her home for a shelter on Saturday after flood waters engulfed her neighborhood. \"I've cried all I can cry.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service on Sunday forecast windy but mostly dry weather in the western and central Midwest states for the next several days, which will help waters recede further. Many Iowa rivers, which saw record flooding two weeks ago, were back near or below flood stage on Sunday.\n\nThe Corps of Engineers at Rock Island, Illinois, reopened two locks on the Mississippi River but said four in the district remained closed with water still 3-5 feet (0.9-1.5 metres) above lock walls.\n\nAt one point 388 miles of the Mississippi River were closed to commercial traffic, from Clinton, Iowa, to the Jefferson Barracks Bridge, just south of St. Louis. The blockages have cost barge companies and other shippers millions of dollars.\n\nThe Midwest storms and torrential rains have killed at least 24 people since late May. More than 38,000 people have been driven from their homes, mostly in Iowa where 83 of 99 counties have been declared disaster areas.\n\nFears that as many as 5 million acres of corn and soybeans have been lost to flooding in the world's largest grain and food exporter pushed corn and livestock prices to record highs in the last week.\n\nThe ripple inflation effect on global food prices as U.S. prices soar has alarmed everyone from central bankers to food aid groups. Fears that livestock herds will be culled because of soaring corn feed prices may push meat prices up for years.\n\nFlood aid and relief issues also poured into the political arena.\n\nDemocratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Saturday that Midwest levee breaks and flood damage were reasons to back his $60 billion spending proposal to modernize U.S. roads, bridges and waterways. Much of that would be financed by downsizing U.S. commitments in Iraq, he said.\n\nIowa Gov. Chet Culver has estimated 45,000 square miles\n\nof his state had been hit by tornadoes or flooding, including 340 towns, with extensive damage to road and rail lines at a cost of \"tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nChemicals from farm fields and other toxic substances left behind as waters recede have created a potential health threat. Damaged municipal sewage systems in places like Cedar Rapids, Iowa, were releasing raw sewage into rivers. But drinking water supplies remain unpolluted in most areas, officials said.\n\nIn Cedar Rapids, where officials have said 4,000 homes were damaged by this month's flooding, government buyout plans estimated at $80 million or more were under discussion.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has 43 disaster recovery centers open across the flooded areas of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin, 56,096 registrations for assistance have been received from disaster victims and more than $115 million approved for housing assistance and other disaster-related needs. More than 5,600 households have filed flood insurance claims.\n\n(Writing by Peter Bohan; editing by Vicki Allen)", "summary": "ST.

This week, Topshop customer Becky Hopper tweeted a picture of her friend (size 8-10) next to a mannequin with exaggeratedly long, skinny legs. Retweeted over 6,000 times, it has seen the high street store accused of promoting poor body image.\n\nSince the Tweet \u2013 which was sent with the hashtags #Topshop #poorbodyimage#irresponsible #fashion #highstreet \u2013 went viral, Hopper\u2019s account has been flooded with similar complaints about skinny mannequins at other high street stores. This follows comparable issues at Primark and the storm around La Perla\u2019s mannequins in May this year \u2013 the lingerie store displayed mannequins with visible ribs and another Twitter outcry ensued. The mannequins have since been removed.\n\nAs representations of women, mannequins are inevitably part of the debate around fashion and body image and reflect the zeitgeist\u2019s idea of what a woman\u2019s body should look like. In Venezuela, for example, mannequins\u2019 shape have changed in response to the exaggerated ideals of beauty promoted in a country where a plastic surgery-honed physique is the ideal. In the UK, most high street stores use models that replicate a size eight or 10 and an impressive height, around 6ft. The average size of a British woman, on the other hand, is closer to a size 16 and stands at 163cm (5ft 4in).\n\nThere have been efforts to address this disparity in recent years. Debenhams began using size 16 models in 2013, a move that was met with praise from Equalities Minister Jo Swinson, as a step towards \u201ccelebrating our diverse society\u201d and reflecting the demand for more realistic representations of women. A study by Cambridge University in 2012 even claimed there is evidence that larger mannequins will shift more units \u2013 as women are more likely to buy clothes when they are advertised or displayed on \u201cwomen\u201d a similar size to them.\n\nMany shops would argue that mannequins aren\u2019t living, breathing idealisations of women. While extremely realistic mannequins exist, the majority are rather more abstract, often featuring rectangular hands and no heads. Sure enough, Topshop\u2019s statement on the Twitter storm \u2013 released on Thursday \u2013 said that Topshop had long \u201cmade it a priority to showcase a healthy size image\u201d, adding: \u201cThe mannequin in question has been used in stores the past four years and is based on a standard UK size 10. The overall height, at 187cm, is taller than the average girl and the form is a stylised one to have more impact in store and create a visual focus. Mannequins are made from solid fibreglass, so in order for clothing to fit, the form of the mannequins needs to be of certain dimensions to allow clothing to be put on and removed; this is therefore not meant to be a representation of the average female body.\u201d\n\nIn the age of online shopping, the cultural influence of dummies in bricks-and-mortar stores is arguably waning \u2013 but the debates continue apace. Even those who have sought to promote positive body image have come under fire. Alongside the praise for the Debenhams size 16 mannequins, for example, came warnings from Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies that larger shop dummies were \u201cnormalising\u201d being overweight. Yesterday, Hopper was moved to write a blog explaining that she had no intention of \u201cbody-shaming skinny girls\u201d, in response to angry messages online.

The overwhelming majority are in Texas, where the state education department has offered to cover the cost of the exam \u2014 $8 per pupil \u2014 as part of a statewide college readiness program.\n\nThe introduction of the test follows a one-year delay that the College Board had imposed in acknowledgment of the stretched-taut finances of many school systems. It created ReadiStep, the board says, in response to the clamoring of school districts for an indication of students\u2019 potential performance \u2014 not just on entrance exams, but also on college-prep coursework \u2014 far earlier than 10th or 11th grade, when most take the PSAT.\n\nIn that spirit, some schools have long given discontinued versions of the PSAT to eighth graders, and scored the exams themselves, though with no formal benchmark for what those scores might mean.\n\n\u201cReadiStep is designed to be very similar to the PSAT and SAT,\u201d says Glenn B. Milewski, executive director of ReadiStep and the PSAT, which is also the qualifying exam for National Merit scholarships. \u201cIt is essentially a learning tool. It\u2019s intended to help schools and districts improve their curricula and instructional practices.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, in a culture that has become increasingly obsessed with the admissions process, especially to premier colleges, it seems fair to ask whether giving middle-schoolers a preview of the PSAT and SAT also gives them a preview of the agita that awaits them.\n\n\u201cWhere does it stop?\u201d wonders Louis J. Kruger, an associate professor in the school psychology program at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cIf you can prepare them in eighth grade, can\u2019t you prepare them even earlier than that? There\u2019s already considerable stress and anxiety today in public school students in regard to being assessed, and the assessment as being a gateway to college.\u201d\n\nOther experts on testing worry that the College Board is preying on anxious parents who only want the best for their children. Will the exam be able to deliver on the seductive come-ons in its promotional materials \u2014 for example, that the results will provide \u201cinformation on the skills that students possess and the skills they need to develop, and advice on how to further develop those skills\u201d?\n\nW. James Popham, professor emeritus in the graduate school of education at the University of California, Los Angeles, recently pored over detailed descriptions of the psychometrics underlying ReadiStep, which has three 40-minute sections to assess an array of skills in critical reading, writing and mathematics. He concluded that any results should be taken with a grain of salt because of insufficient items \u201cto allow teachers, students or students\u2019 parents to arrive at a reasonably accurate estimate of a student\u2019s per-skill prowess.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just deceptive as can be,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt conveys the notion that your child has these strengths and weaknesses, when there\u2019s no way to tell.\u201d\n\nAsked about Dr. Popham\u2019s comments, Mr. Milewski seemed to take pains to lower expectations for what specifics parents might learn from the results. Students receive only three scores \u2014 one for each subtest \u2014 along with \u201csuggestions\u201d for how to \u201cimprove their learning\u201d based on the broad band in which they scored \u2014 for example, low (2 to 2.9) or high (6 to 8).\n\nThose inclined to lump in Dr. Popham with FairTest \u2014 an organization that was sharply critical of ReadiStep during its development and which angrily laments the proliferation of standardized testing in American education \u2014 should bear in mind that Dr. Popham is actually an advocate for such exams. \u201cIt\u2019s not the early testing that bothers me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the early, wrong kind of testing.\u201d\n\nMargo Gigee, the director of advanced academics for the Pearland Independent School District, in a Houston suburb, has no such qualms. Last fall, Pearland administered ReadiStep to all but a handful of the community\u2019s 1,300 eighth graders.\n\nMs. Gigee ticks off the battery of state tests to which the district\u2019s eighth graders are already subjected \u2014 including in math, reading, social studies and science. Then she asks, rhetorically: \u201cWhy do one more test? What\u2019s the point?\u201d She cites research that suggests that if students \u201cdon\u2019t have a college mind-set by fourth grade, then it\u2019s not as likely to happen.\u201d\n\nPearland students who took the PSAT twice \u2014 some even donning the jerseys of their favorite colleges during the exam \u2014 scored about 120 points higher on the SAT\u2019s three subtests than those who did not take the PSAT, she says.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be good at it,\u201d she says, explaining her support for ReadiStep, \u201cyou have to practice.\u201d\n\nIn Fort Worth, Patty Jimenez, a stay-at-home mother who attended only junior college, believes that her daughter Kelly\u2019s chances of attending a four-year college were improved by her exposure to ReadiStep. She was discouraged when she arrived home on exam day last fall.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do well,\u201d she told her mother.\n\nBut when the results came out and district officials held a meeting to explain them to parents, Ms. Jimenez realized that Kelly had actually scored quite high. And that success built confidence. \u201cShe knows her ultimate goal is college,\u201d Ms. Jimenez says. \u201cShe wants to get good, passing scores and stay on track.\u201d\n\nJacques Steinberg oversees The Choice.

Insane Clown Posse, the love-\u2019em-or-hate-\u2019em pair that perform as Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope, practice the love-it-or-hate-it rap variant known as horrorcore\u2026but more on that later. Theirs is an insular world and non-fans might be understandably overwhelmed trying to process their complicated backstory and attendant subculture, even as the band\u2019s mainstream presence is bigger than ever. Though ICP has been rapping for about 25 years, their transition from the underground to having their own TV show has been less of a steady climb than a sudden leap.\n\n(MORE: It\u2019s Not TV, It\u2019s the Emmys)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all relatively brand new. All our lives we figured that when the band gets a little bit older, we\u2019re going to start doing stuff on TV. What we were going to do on TV we had no idea,\u201d Violent J tells TIME. \u201cNext thing you know, somehow, due to the turning of the clouds and the planets aligned, [Fuse] called us and said come out to New York and talk about a TV show.\u201d\n\nOf course, we had some more (and more basic) questions for him\u2014like: What is \u201chorrorcore\u201d?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like when you used to go to a Blockbuster video for movies: there\u2019s romance movies, there\u2019s action-packed movies and there\u2019s horror movies. Music is a lot like that,\u201d explains Violent J. \u201cThere\u2019s super high-speed rock, there\u2019s ballads, and believe it or not\u2014it\u2019s a small section and not very many artists do it\u2014 there\u2019s horror music.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s with the face paint?\n\nViolent J and Shaggy 2 Dope are characters in the horror story, the former explains, which allows them to sing about horrific topics. \u201cIt\u2019s all fake; it\u2019s not real. You don\u2019t actually think we\u2019re murderers but we rap about it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe rap about dark, grim things but it\u2019s storytelling. I play the role of Violent J, my partner plays Shaggy 2 Dope, and we\u2019re wicked clowns from the dark carnival, but there are many secrets beyond that and many clues to unlock as you go.\u201d\n\nSome ICP albums are \u201cJoker\u2019s Cards,\u201d all of which are supposed to fit together to reveal a message. And the liner notes are meant to make listeners ask questions. \u201cThe messages were ways of looking at yourself before it\u2019s too late, asking you to take a look at yourself in the mirror: Are you good for the planet and people in general? Or are you bad for the planet and people?\u201d he asks. (And though he admits that the message is one that meshes with spirituality, he says it has nothing to do with any specific religion.)\n\nThe fans, says Violent J, are the real Insane Clown Posse story; he calls ICP fandom \u201cthe Juggalo movement.\u201d He says that the music is directed at people who perhaps, like the duo themselves, dropped out of school, or are bullied or simply misunderstood. The annual festival for ICP fans is called the Gathering of the Juggalos; this year\u2019s takes place in Cave-In-Rock, Ill., from Aug. 7\u201311. But, says Violent J, the music isn\u2019t really the point: \u201cListening to our music is hard to do. You get picked on just for listening. When you get to the Gathering, there\u2019s all these people that share your interests, this euphoria comes over you, you can go up to anybody and they\u2019ll give you a cheeseburger. We just provide the soundtrack to it all.\u201d (There is a history of violence at the Gathering, too, but Violent J\u2014ironically\u2014claims that problems are more likely to come from \u201chotdog vendors\u201d and other outsiders than from the Juggalos themselves.)\n\nWhy would fans get picked on?\n\nIt\u2019s not just that they wear face paint too: Insane Clown Posse calls itself the most hated band in the world; just this month GQ named them the worst rappers ever. Violent J believes out that when ICP did a song with Jack White in 2011, it only made news because nobody could believe Jack White would associate himself with the group, and he says that the group has always received completely negative reviews. \u201cWhat we do is so easy to pick on,\u201d he says, adding that when the band does receive respect it\u2019s often in the form of a backhanded compliment. \u201cPeople look at us and say, \u2018These guys have gotta be creative geniuses, because how else could they sell that music?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut now you have a TV show. What changed?\n\nViolent J\u2019s theory: the Internet. One of the first hints that ICP would be getting a lot more mainstream attention was the response to the 2010 music video for their song \u201cMiracles\u201d:\n\nThe trippy clip merited an SNL spoof\u2014proof, says Violent J, that enough people would get the joke to make it worth airing, which he attributes to the power of YouTube. (The video has clocked 12 million views.) \u201cBack in the \u201890s, only the biggest, die-hardest fans had actually seen our videos,\u201d he says. \u201cNowadays, we operate in this glass office where anybody can see us. \u2018Miracles\u2019 wasn\u2019t anything different; that was just another ICP video. You don\u2019t have to be a super die-hard fan to dive into our world.\u201d And once people start watching their music videos on YouTube, they might watch ICP comedy clips\u2026which eventually leads to a TV show.\n\n(MORE: 11 Best Music Videos of 2013 (So Far))\n\nThe duo does have one idea for what they could do if astronomical wealth comes their way. \u201cWe always talk about, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t be great if we could get a giant apartment complex and we owned them all and all the Juggalos could live together?\u2019\u201d Violent J says. \u201cWhat if it 20 years we could put the money down?

The couple's young son also was slain in the family's Georgia home.\n\nThe order is a victory for the estate of Nancy Benoit, which is seeking damages from Hustler.\n\nAt issue was whether the constitutional right of privacy indirectly referenced in the 14th Amendment trumps the First Amendment protections of the media and publishers in this \"right-of-publicity\" dispute.\n\nThe original lawsuit was brought by Maureen Toffoloni, whose daughter, Nancy Benoit, had posed nude for a photographer more than two decades ago. Toffoloni claims that her daughter, who was also known by the wrestling moniker Woman, had asked immediately after the shoot to have the photos and video destroyed and believed that photographer Mark Samansky had done so.\n\nHe later sold stills from the video to Hustler, a men's magazine founded by Larry Flynt that publishes racy material. The photos were published in the March 2008 issue.\n\nThe murders had occurred the previous summer. At the center of the crimes was Chris Benoit, a Canadian-born athlete who worked for several professional wrestling circuits, including the popular World Wrestling Entertainment. In 2000, he married Nancy Sullivan, a Florida native who had become a well-known wrestling manager after her time in the ring. Their son, Daniel, was born earlier that year.\n\nPolice say the crimes occurred over a three-day period in June 2007 at the Atlanta-area home of the Benoits. Investigators concluded that Chris Benoit first bound his 43-year-old wife and strangled her. The 7-year-old boy was then drugged and strangled. The man then committed suicide by hanging himself with a weight machine. No formal motive was ever established.\n\nCNN reported at the time that doctors found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of 40-year-old Chris Benoit, according to Georgia's chief medical examiner. Performance-enhancing anabolic steroids were later found in the home.\n\nWeeks after the killings, a study of Chris Benoit's brain showed damage from \"prior repetitive injury.\" His father, Michael Benoit, said on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" that a series of concussions from his high-flying moves in the ring were in part to blame.\n\nGeorgia has a law similar to many states' recognizing the right to privacy against \"the appropriation of another's name and likeness ... without consent and for the financial gain of the appropriator.\" That would include \"a private citizen, entertainer, or a public figure who is not a public official\" like a legislator.\n\nThe state's high court ruled against Hustler magazine in June, finding that a \"brief biography\" of Nancy Benoit and her murder accompanying the nude photos did not represent a \"newsworthy article.\"\n\n\"The photographs published by [Flynt] neither relate to the incident of public concern conceptually [the murders] nor correspond with the time period during which Benoit was rendered, against her will, the subject of public scrutiny,\" the state court wrote. \"Were we to hold otherwise, [Flynt] would be free to publish any nude photograph of almost anyone without their permission, simply because the fact they were caught nude on camera strikes someone as 'newsworthy.' Surely that debases the very concept of a right to privacy.\"\n\nThe state justices said \"crude though the concept may seem,\" Nancy Benoit's mother is now entitled to control such images \"in order to maximize the economic benefit to be derived from her daughter's posthumous fame.\" Such power is known legally as the \"right of publicity.\"\n\nFlynt and the photographer, Samansky, later filed the appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court and had the support of several media organizations.\n\nIn a brief filed in support of Hustler, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said the Georgia ruling \"makes no sense, as it goes well beyond the photographs that appear in magazines such as petitioner's to affect all news-gathering.\"\n\nThe group noted that other courts have long recognized a broadly read \"newsworthiness\" standard for commercial media like CNN and that such specific \"dissection\" of content-based stories and pictorials by judges would cripple editorial decision-making by all news outlets.\n\nThe case is LFP Publishing Group (dba Hustler Magazine) v.

While the overwhelming majority of violence and abuse against women is men\u2019s violence, the majority of men are not violent. However, men are often silent about the violence that other men perpetrate. But this week saw a group of powerful men step forward: NFL players, current and former, saying NO MORE to domestic violence and sexual assault in a series of groundbreaking new PSAs.\n\nPlayers like Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 William Gay, whose mother was killed by an abusive partner. Like Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Jon Dorrembos, who lost his mother at the hands of his father when he was twelve years old.\n\nFormer players like Troy Vincent, now the NFL\u2019s Executive Vice President of Football Operations, whose mother is a survivor of domestic violence. These men, along with nearly two dozen others, are speaking up for each other, for the people they love, for their families, their children, mothers and fathers, friends, teammates, for people they\u2019ve never met and for themselves. The new \u201cNFL Players Say NO MORE\u201d PSAs are centered around the first, unifying symbol for the movement to end domestic violence and sexual assault: NO MORE. With the support of hundreds of national and local groups committed to bringing an end to this violence, NO MORE is working to move these issues out of the margins of public and political concern, where they have lived for too long. We have come to treat these crimes as all but inevitable, passively accepting that they are part of society\u2019s fabric. And yes, these crimes affect all ages, in all geographical locations, across all socio-economic divisions. As the NFL players demonstrated once again, these crimes touch everyone. They are not, however, part of our societal fabric -- quite the opposite, they tear society apart. But the attitudes that allow these crimes to continue, those are indeed embedded in our thinking, our attitudes, and interactions. NO MORE is determined to dismantle those attitudes, and to end every action that contributes to domestic violence and sexual assault continuing in the world. \u201cTogether we can end domestic violence and sexual assault\u201d reads the tag line for NO MORE. The most important word in that phrase? \u201cTogether.\u201d We are encouraged and deeply moved by the NFL players who now stand together with us in this effort, and who will undoubtedly encourage other men to do the same.\n\nIn speaking out, they have modeled a bold and stirring use of their formidable power. Sports unite us like few things can, and athletes have a singular authority in our society, most especially for the young. What these NFL athletes will demonstrate to their peers and to younger generations in these PSAs is invaluable. Many people contributed mightily to creating these PSAs: Viacommunity (Viacom\u2019s social impact umbrella), Young & Rubicam, the Joyful Heart Foundation, photographer Timothy White, as well as the PSAs directors: Mariska, Tate Donovan and Blair Underwood\u2014just to name a few. NFL players are now doing their part. Which leads many people to ask: what is my part? Most simply, do what William Gay, Jon Dorrembos, and Troy Vincent did: use your voice. Talk about the issues. Normalize the conversation. Challenge attitudes and actions around you. Examine and challenge your own. Become the person at your school, your workplace, your place of worship, who knows the most about these issues.\n\nVolunteer at or give financially to a local organization. Stop saying things that denigrate women and girls, like \u201cStop acting like a sissy\u201d or \u201cYou throw like a girl.\u201d\n\nBe an example. Be a leader. And when you\u2019re watching a game this weekend and the PSA comes on, and your child asks what that was all about, be a hero. Engage in the conversation, and model what it means to be a person who is committed to changing the world. Stand with us. Say NO MORE.\n\nMariska Hargitay is the Founder & President of the Joyful Heart Foundation and the Emmy Award-winning star of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\n\nTed Bunch is the co-founder of A CALL TO MEN, the leading national men\u2019s violence prevention organization helping to develop and champion the NO MORE movement.", "summary": "This week saw a group of powerful men step forward: NFL players, current and former, saying NO MORE to domestic violence and sexual assault in a series of groundbreaking new PSAs.", "density": 35.0, "coverage": 1.0, "compression": 25.3142857143, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}, {"url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/longballs-hot-stuff-yankees-atlanta-braves-wage-slugfest-sweltering-day-yankee-stadium-article-1.1099600", "archive": "https://web.archive.org/web/2012062219id_/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/longballs-hot-stuff-yankees-atlanta-braves-wage-slugfest-sweltering-day-yankee-stadium-article-1.1099600", "title": "Home runs are hot stuff as Yankees, Atlanta Braves wage slugfest on sweltering day at Yankee Stadium", "date": "2012062219", "text": "Robinson Cano celebrates his solo homer in the sixth inning.\n\nThey turned up the heat at Yankee Stadium Wednesday and that, in turn, made for a \u201cWelcome to summer\u201d home run derby that left both starters, Phil Hughes and the Braves\u2019 Tommy Hanson, exiting with whiplash.\n\nWhile city heat waves tend to create power outages, the rise in temperatures seems to have the opposite effect at Yankee Stadium, causing baseballs to fly out at an even more dizzying rate than normal. At the end of the day, the home run count stood at nine, with the Braves winning both the game, 10-5, and the derby, 5-4. In the end, Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez let loose an enormous sigh of relief.\n\nFor there are those old schoolers who might have accused Gonzalez of a breach of baseball etiquette by calling for Juan Francisco to steal second after his leadoff single in the ninth with the Braves leading, 9-5, thanks to Jason Heyward\u2019s second homer of the game the inning before. But as Gonzalez explained: \u201cWith their lineup and this ballpark, we needed to keep adding on.\u201d\n\nGonzalez admitted to being especially nervous in the seventh inning when Chad Durbin, his second reliever, walked two and gave up an RBI single to Curtis Granderson, bringing Alex Rodriguez to the plate with one out, runners at first and third and the score now 6-5 Braves. An inning earlier, even A-Rod had joined the home run brigade when one of his newly patented, sky-high warning-track shots barely made it over the right field fence. This time, however, he was unable to get the ball in the air and instead grounded to shortstop for a deflating inning-ending double play.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with their lineup and that (right field) porch,\u201d Gonzalez said, \u201cand after a couple of walks and A-Rod at the plate in that situation . . . it was a scary moment.\u201d\n\nCertainly understandable given the Yankee home run stats this year. Coming into the game, their 101 homers led the majors and they were 40-13 in games in which they had gone deep. Even more imposing was their 29-5 record in multi-homer games, especially since, to that point in the game, they had already hit four, all off Hanson. On their recent 10-game winning streak (in which they homered in nine of the games), they hit 17 all told. And at Yankee Stadium, they had out-homered the opposition, 54-35.\n\nNot on this day. Nobody had to tell Gonzalez that to beat the Yankees, you have to keep them in the ballpark. Hanson was unable to do that, but fortunately for him, his counterpart, Hughes, wasn\u2019t able to to it to the Braves, either. Freddie Freeman hit a two-run homer off him in the first, and Martin Prado, Heyward and David Ross hit solo shots in the third, fourth and fifth, respectively. Hughes was excused by Joe Girardi after 41/3 innings, trailing 6-1.\n\nAtlanta Braves left fielder Martin Prado (14) comes home on a home run in the 3rd inning Wednesday.\n\n\u201c(Hughes) made some mistakes with his fastball,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t have great location today. The ball was flying out today.\u201d\n\nThough Girardi wouldn\u2019t say it, what probably annoyed him a whole lot more than losing the home run derby was the Yankees\u2019 continuing hitting woes with runners in scoring position. They were 1-for-4 in those situations Wednesday, the most egregious, of course, being A-Rod\u2019s double play ball. They are batting .218 with runners in scoring position, 27th-worst in the majors and last in the AL.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re going to score our most runs hitting home runs,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cBut the (runners in scoring position) is something we need to get better at. It\u2019s just not happening for us. It\u2019s just one of those things you have to fight through. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been as long as it\u2019s gone on for any team that\u2019s 14 games over .500.\u201d\n\nT he forecast was for even hotter temps on Thursday, when there will be no baseball played at Yankee Stadium. It is an off-day for Girardi\u2019s sluggers before the second Subway Series against the Mets.
